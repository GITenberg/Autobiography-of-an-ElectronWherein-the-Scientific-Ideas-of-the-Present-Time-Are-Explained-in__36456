<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>Although text-books of science may appear
to the general reader to be "very dry"
material, there is no doubt that, when scientific
facts and theories are put into everyday
language, the general reader is genuinely
interested. The reception accorded to the
present author's <i>Scientific Ideas of To-day</i>
bears out this fact. While that volume explains,
in non-technical language, the latest
scientific theories, it aims at giving a fairly
full account, which, of course, necessitates
going into a great deal of detail. That the
book has been appreciated by very varied
classes of readers is evident from the large
numbers of appreciative letters received from
different quarters. But the author believes
that if the story of modern science were told
in a still more popular style, it would serve
a further useful purpose. For there are
readers who do not care to go into details,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and yet would like to take an intelligent interest
in the scientific progress of the present
day. Some of those readers do not wish to
trouble about names and dates, while the
mere mention of rates of vibration and such-like
is a worry to them. They wish a book
which they may read with the same ease as
an interesting novel. Hence the form of
the present volume.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to Professor James
Muir, M.A., D.Sc., of the Glasgow and West
of Scotland Technical College, and to H. Stanley
Allen, M.A., D.Sc., Senior Lecturer in
Physics at King's College, University of
London, for very kindly reading the proof-sheets.

<h2>WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT</h2>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>The reason for writing this story is given
in the Preface, but the title is so strange
that the reader will wish naturally to know
what the story is about. What is an electron?
Is it an imaginary thing, or is it a
reality?</p>

<p>One of the reasons for writing this story
in its present form is to help the reader to
realise that electrons are not mythical, but
real existing things, and by far the most
interesting things we know anything about.
The discovery of electrons has shed a new
light upon the meaning of very many things
which have been puzzles until now. They
give us a reasonable explanation of the cause
of light and colour. They provide a new idea
of the constitution of matter. They enable
us to picture an electric current, and they
give us definite, though by no means final,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
answers to the why and wherefore of magnetism,
chemical union, and radio-activity.</p>

<p>The story is imaginary only in so far that
one of the electrons itself is supposed to tell
the tale. But in the endeavour to make
the story interesting, there has been no
sacrifice of accuracy in the statements of
fact.</p>

<p>While all names and dates, and many other
details, have been kept out rigidly from the
story, a note of the more important of these
has been added in an Appendix for the sake
of those readers who may wish to refer to
them.</p>

<p>It will be well to introduce the electron to
the reader before leaving it to speak for
itself. We have definite experimental proof
of the existence of electrons, and yet it is
very difficult to realise their existence, for
two reasons. In the first place, they are so
infinitesimally small. We count a microbe a
small thing; we can see it only with the aid
of a very powerful microscope. Yet that
little speck of matter contains myriads of
particles or <i>atoms</i>. An atom of matter is
therefore an inconceivably little thing, but
even that is a great giant compared to an
elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>tron.
Our second difficulty in realising the
existence of an electron is that it is not any
form of what we call <i>matter</i>; it is a particle of
<i>electricity</i>, whatever that may be.</p>

<p>From the earliest experiments it became
evident that there were two distinct kinds of
electricity. These were described by the
pioneer workers as <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i>
electricities. To-day we have definite experimental
proof that negative electricity is
composed of separate particles or units. Just
as matter is composed of invisible atoms, so
also is negative electricity of an atomic
nature. These particles of negative electricity
have been christened electrons, <i>electron</i>
being the Greek word for <i>amber</i>, from which
man first obtained electricity. Of course no
one can ever hope to see an electron, but
physicists have been able to determine its
size and <i>mass</i>, its electric charge, and the
speeds at which it moves.</p>

<p>While it has been known for more than
a century that <i>light</i> is merely waves in the
all-pervading &aelig;ther of space, set up by incandescent
bodies, it has been a puzzle always
how matter could cause waves in the &aelig;ther, as
it offers no resistance to the movement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
matter through it. Here we are on the back
of a great planet, flying through space at
the enormous rate of one thousand miles per
minute, and yet our flimsy atmospheric
blanket is in no way disturbed by the &aelig;ther
through which we are flying. In the following
story we shall see that these electrons
help us towards a solution of this and many
other problems; they provide the missing link
between matter and the &aelig;ther.</p>

<p>But what is this <i>&aelig;ther</i> of which one hears
so much in these days? The truth is we know
nothing of its nature. We cannot say whether
it is lighter than the lightest gas or denser
than the densest solid. The &aelig;ther, whatever
it may be, is as real as the air we breathe. It
is the medium which brings us light and heat
from the sun, and which carries our wireless
telegraph and telephone messages. The
whole universe is moving in this great &aelig;ther
ocean.</p>

<p>In order to make the electron's story
perfectly intelligible to every reader, I have
added a short explanatory note at the beginning
of each chapter. These notes merely
state the facts about which the electron is
speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
To make the electron's story as realistic as
possible, it has been necessary to give the
imaginary electron perfect freedom of knowledge
concerning itself and its surroundings.
In our schooldays we had to write the
autobiographies of steel pens, and such-like,
but these inanimate things had to be endowed
with powers of thought, feeling, and desire.
It is very important, however, to remember
that an electron is a particle of negative
electricity&mdash;<i>a real existing thing</i>.</p>

While many scientific men now understand
our place in the universe, we electrons are
anxious that every person should know the
very important part which we play in the
workaday world. It was for this reason
that my fellow-electrons urged me to write
my own biography. My difficulty has been
to find a scribe who would put down my
story in the way I desired. The first man
with whom I opened negotiations wished me
to give him dates and names of which I knew
nothing. And he asked such stupid questions
about where I was born and who my parents
were, as if I were flesh and blood.</p>

<p>I am pleased to say that my relationship
with the scribe who has put down my story
in the following pages has been of the most
friendly description. Apart from a little tiff
which we had at the outset, there has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
no difference of opinion. He complained that
I related things in too abstract a form. However,
we got over the difficulty by a compromise;
I have allowed him to place what
he calls "The Scribe's Note" at the beginning
of each chapter, but it will be understood
clearly that these are merely convenient
embellishments, and that I am responsible for
the story of my own experiences.</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER THREE</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It will be well to keep clearly in mind
that an electron is a real particle of negative
electricity.</p>

<p>Electrons have been discovered only within
recent years.</p>

<p>No matter from what substances we take
them, they are always identical in every respect.</p>

<p>Some electrons are attached to the atoms
of matter in such a way that they may be
removed easily from one object to another.</p>

<p>When a surplus of these detachable electrons
is crowded on to any object, we say that
it is charged with negative electricity.</p>

<p>We speak of the other object, which has
lost these same electrons, as being charged
with positive electricity.</p>

<p>In this chapter the electron refers to the
old-world experiment in which a piece of
amber when rubbed attracts any light object
to it.</p>

<p>For many ages man believed this to be a
special property belonging to amber alone.</p>

<p>One of Queen Elizabeth's physicians discovered
that this property was common to
all substances.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
It is most amusing to me and my fellow-electrons
to hear intelligent people speak of
us as though we were new arrivals on this
planet. Dear me! We were here for countless
ages before man put in an appearance.
I wonder if any man can realise that we have
been on the move ever since the foundations
of this world were laid. It is man himself
who is the new arrival.</p>

<p>It does seem strange to us that men should
be so distinctly different from one another.
We electrons are at a decided disadvantage,
for we are all identical in every respect. I
have no individual name&mdash;it would serve no
purpose. Even if you could see me, you
could not distinguish me from any other
electron. I wonder sometimes if men appreciate
the great advantage they have in possessing
individual names. I was impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
with this thought one fine summer morning.
While I was riding on the back of a particle
of gas in the atmosphere, I was carried
through the open window of a nursery just
as the under-nurse was putting the room in
order. A little later there was some commotion
in the nursery, for the young mother
and her mother had come to see the twin
daughters being bathed by the nurses. The
grandmother happened to remark how very
much alike the two little infants were. She
said laughingly to the head nurse that she
must be careful not to get the children mixed.
But the big brother, aged five years, remarked
that it would not matter really how much
they were mixed until they got their names.
Sometimes I wish we electrons did differ from
one another, so that we might each possess an
individual name, but no doubt it is necessary
for us all to be exactly alike.</p>

<p>Long before man had discovered us, he
caused us deliberately to do certain things.
He was mystified by the results of his experiments,
for he was not aware of our presence.
A few of my fellow-electrons have rather
hazy recollections of being disturbed while
clinging to a piece of amber. They had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
disturbed often before in a similar way, by
being rubbed against a piece of woollen cloth,
and the result had been always that a number
of electrons let go their hold upon the cloth
and crowded on to the amber. The overcrowding
was uncomfortable, but it happened
usually that the surplus electrons found some
means of escape to the earth, where there is
no need of excessive crowding.</p>

<p>On the occasion to which I refer, it so
happened that the rubbing had been unusually
vigorous and prolonged, so that
the electrons were crowded on to the amber
in great numbers. In their endeavour to
escape they produced a strain or stress in
the surrounding &aelig;ther, and this caused a
small piece of straw, which was lying within
the disturbed area, to be forced towards
the amber.</p>

<p>What attracted the attention of the electrons
was that the man who was holding
the piece of amber removed the clinging
straw and replaced it exactly where it had
been lying. In the meantime he had been
handling the amber, and many of the crowded
electrons had managed to make a bolt for
the earth by way of the man's body. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
did this so very quietly that the man did
not feel any sensation. However, as soon
as the amber was rubbed again, a similar
crowd provided the same attractive property.
We electrons became impatient to hear what
man would say of our work, for it was
apparent that he had noticed the movements
of the straw. You will hardly believe me
when I tell you to what decision these wise
men of the East came. They declared that,
in rubbing the amber, it had received heat
and life. As if life could be originated in
any such simple manner!</p>

<p>You can picture our disappointment when
we found that man was going to ignore our
presence. Occasionally we were given opportunities
of displaying our abilities in drawing
light objects towards pieces of rubbed amber.
But the funny thing was that man got hold
of the stupid idea that this attractive property
belonged to the amber instead of to us. If
he had only tried pieces of sulphur, resin,
or glass, he would have found that these
substances would have acted just as well.
You see it was not really the substance,
but we electrons who were the active agents.</p>

<p>We had given up all hope of being
dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>covered,
when news came along that a learned
man was on the hunt for us. He was crowding
us on to all sorts of substances. He rubbed
a piece of glass with some silk, and at first
he was surprised greatly to see light objects
jump towards the excited glass. Of course,
we were not surprised in the very least. The
only thing that amused us was to find that
he was making out a list of the different
substances which showed attractive properties
when rubbed. He could not, evidently, get
away from the idea that it was the substances
themselves that became attractive.</p>

<p>We were sorry that the poor experimenter
wasted so much time and energy in trying
to crowd us on to a piece of metal rod. He
rubbed and he rubbed that metal, but it
would attract nothing, and I shall tell you
the reason. You know that we electrons
hate overcrowding; indeed we always separate
from one another as far as possible when
there is no force pulling us together. We
only crowded on to the amber because we
could not help ourselves; we had no way
of escape, for amber is a substance we cannot
pass through. But we have no difficulty
whatever in making our way along a piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of metal, and as soon as the rubbing began,
some electrons moved off the metal by way
of the man's arm and body to make room
for those being crowded on to the metal from
the rubber. And so there never was any
overcrowding, and consequently no straining
of the &aelig;ther. But it was not long before
we found that man had succeeded in cutting
off our way of escape. He had attached a glass
handle to the metal rod, and we were compelled
to overcrowd upon the metal as we could
not pass through the glass handle. Neighbouring
light objects were attracted by the
excited or "electrified" metal. Even this
demonstration did not put man upon our
track.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should explain in passing, that
when a glass rod is rubbed with a silk handkerchief
we crowd on to the silk, and not on to
the glass. This leaves the glass rod short
of electrons, and the &aelig;ther is strained so that
light objects are attracted. Man did notice
that there was some difference between a
piece of amber and a piece of glass when
these were excited. What the difference was
he could not imagine, but to distinguish the
two different conditions he said that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
amber was charged with <i>negative</i> electricity
and the glass with <i>positive</i> electricity.</p>

<p>From that time forward man became of
special interest to us. We felt sure that
sooner or later he was bound to recognise
that we were at work behind the scenes. It
seemed to us, however, that man was desperately
slow in turning his attention towards
us, and we tried to waken him up in a rather
alarming fashion, as I shall relate in the
succeeding chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Now I must tell you of a surprise in which
I took an active part. Some man thought
he would separate a great crowd of us from
our friends. Of course, he did not think
really of <i>us</i>, but whatever he may have
supposed he was doing, he succeeded in
accumulating greater crowds of us together
than he had done previously. He managed
this by making simple machines to do the
rubbing for him on a larger scale. The
result was really too much for us; we were
kept crowding on to a sort of brass comb
arrangement from which we could not escape,
as the metal was attached to a glass support.
Talk about overcrowding! I had never experienced
the like before, and I felt sure
some catastrophe would happen. Suddenly
there was a stampede, during which a great
crowd of electrons forced their way across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to a neighbouring object and thence to the
earth. I can assure you it was no joke
getting through the air. We all tried to
leap together, but some of the crowd were
forced back upon us; then bang forward
we went again, back once more, and so on
till we settled down to our normal condition.
Of course all this surging to and fro occupied
far less time than it takes to tell. Indeed, I
could not tell you what a very small fraction
of a second it took.</p>

<p>I wish you had seen the experimenter's
surprise as we made this jump. We caused
such a bombardment in the air that there
was a bright spark accompanied by a regular
explosion. Some men ran away with the
idea that electricity was a mysterious fire,
which only showed itself when it mixed with
the atmosphere. Nothing delighted us more,
after our own surprise was over, than to
have a chance of repeating these explosions,
to the alarm of the experimenters. But the
best sport of all was to come, and when I
heard of it I was so disappointed that I had
not been one of the sporting party. It came
about in the following way.</p>

  <p class="smcap bold center">Damage Done by a Party of Electrons</p>

  <p>When a myriad of electrons is discharged suddenly from a cloud to
  the earth, it happens sometimes that considerable damage is done.
  The above photograph is of a church steeple damaged by lightning
  in 1875. No lightning-conductor was provided, so the electrons
  had to get to earth by way of the steeple itself, with the
  disastrous result as shown.</p>
</div>

<p>One learned man thought he had hit upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a good idea. He tried to crowd a tremendous
number of us into some water contained in a
glass jar. Without condescending to think
of us, he crowded an enormous number of
electrons from one of his rubbing machines
along a piece of chain which led them into
water. The overcrowding was appalling, for
it was impossible to escape through the glass
vessel. Things had reached a terrible state,
when the experimenter stopped the machine
and put forward his hand to lift the chain
out of the water. Now was the chance of
escape, so the whole excited crowd made one
wild rush to earth by way of the experimenter's
body. The rapid surging to and fro
of the crowd racked the man's muscles. I
wish I had been there to see him jump; they
say it was something grand. You can imagine
how the little sinners enjoyed the joke; they
knew they were safe, as man had no idea
of their existence at that time.</p>

<p>Another man was foolhardy enough to try
a similar experiment, and they say that his
alarm was even greater; indeed, he swore he
would not take another shock even for the
crown of France. We were all eager to get
opportunities of alarming man, not that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wished him any harm, but we thought he
might pay us a little more attention.</p>

<p>I remember one occasion upon which some
of us were boasting of what we had done
in the way of alarming men, whereupon one
fellow-electron rather belittled our doings.
He maintained that he had jumped all the
way from a cloud to the earth, along with
a crowd of other electrons. In doing so
they had scared the inhabitants of a whole
village, for they alighted upon the steeple
of a church, and in their wild rush they played
such havoc among the atoms composing the
steeple that they did considerable outward
damage to the great structure.</p>

<p>I may as well confess that we are not free
agents in performing these gigantic jumps;
we are compelled to go with the crowd when
things are in such a state of stress. We
simply cannot hold on to the atoms of matter
upon which we happen to be located. It is
only under very considerable pressure that
we can perform this class of jump, and I
beg to assure you that we are perfectly helpless
in those cases where we have been dashed
upon some poor creature with a message of
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Alas! on one occasion I was one of a party
who killed a very learned man. It was most
distasteful to us; we could not possibly prevent
it. He had erected a long rod which
extended up into the air, and terminated at
the lower end in his laboratory. Some of
us who were in the upper atmosphere were
forced on to this iron rod, and from past
experience we quite expected that we should
be subjected to a sudden expulsion to earth.
Indeed we were waiting for the experimenter
to provide us with a means of escape, when
suddenly he brought his head too near to
the end of the rod, and in a moment we
were dashed to earth through his body. We
learned with deep regret that the poor man
had been robbed of his life.</p>

<p>To turn to something of a happier nature,
I shall proceed to tell you of some of my
earliest recollections. Remember I shall be
speaking of a time long before man existed&mdash;even
before this great planet was a solid ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Before giving an account of the everyday
duties which we perform, it may interest
you to hear something of our early history.</p>

<p>Not only have we been on the move ever
since the beginning of this world, but some
of us have clear recollections of this planet
long before it was a solid body. The whole
world was a great ball of flaming gas. I
have heard some fellow-electrons say that
we were attached to a greater mass of incandescent
gas before the beginning of this
world, but I have no personal recollections
of it. But one thing I do remember is a
great upheaval which caused a large mass
of gas to become detached from our habitation.
Without any warning a great myriad
of our fellow-electrons were carried away
on this smaller mass. At first this detached
mass circled around our greater mass at very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
close quarters, but we soon found that our
friends were being carried farther and farther
away, until they are now circling around this
solid planet at a comparatively great distance.
Man calls this detached mass <i>the moon</i>, and
when I have heard children say in fun that
they wish they could visit the man in the
moon, I have longed to go and see how it
fares with those fellow-electrons who seem
to be separated from us in such a permanent
manner.</p>

<p>After this exciting event, which I have
heard described as "the birth of the moon,"
our great ball of flaming gas began to cool
gradually. But you will be interested in what
happened before the moon's birth. I saw a
crowd of electrons suddenly congregate together
along with <i>something</i> else which man
has not discovered. Never mind the other
part, but picture a number of electrons forming
a little world of their own. There they
went whirling around in a giddy dance. I
saw these little worlds or "atoms" being
formed all around, and I feel truly thankful
now that I was not caught in the mad whirl,
for these fellow-electrons have been kept
hard at it ever since, imprisoned within a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
single atom. I have met a very few electrons
who have escaped from within an atom, but I
shall tell you about them later on.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that each of
the atoms had practically the same number
of electrons in it. At that time I thought
only in an abstract way, but since then I have
learned that these were <i>hydrogen</i> atoms;
hydrogen being the lightest substance known
to man. Exactly what happened next I cannot
recollect, but my attention was attracted
later to larger congregations of electrons
forming other little worlds of their own.
These atoms were, of course, heavier than
the hydrogen atoms. I saw quite a variety
of different systems, of which I thought then
in an abstract fashion, but which I know now
to be atoms of <i>oxygen</i>, <i>nitrogen</i>, <i>carbon</i>, <i>iron</i>,
<i>copper</i>, and so on. While man has given the
atoms these distinguishing names, you will
understand that the incidents which I am
relating took place long before there was
any appearance of solidity about our planet;
these substances were all in a gaseous state.</p>

<p>After this, I recollect that there was a
great envelope of water-vapour condensed
around the planet. Some condensed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
liquid water upon the surface of the globe,
while part was suspended in the form of
clouds. Some of my fellow-electrons acted
as <i>nuclei</i> or foundations for the formation
of the cloud particles. The water which condensed
upon the earth settled down in the
hollows, which had been produced previously
by the immense pressure of the water-vapour
envelope. We can hardly believe it is the
same world.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine how strange it was
to see the great oceans boiling and steaming;
of course, they were fresh water then.
I need hardly tell you that they have become
salt only because the rivers have
brought down sodium into them, and when
these sodium atoms unite with chlorine atoms
they form particles of common salt. I know
all about this because we electrons play a
very important part in all such combinations.</p>

<p>One very memorable recollection is that
of life originating in the oceans. I wish I
could let you into the secret of <i>the origin
of life</i>, but, according to the Creator's plan,
man must find out for himself. Your guesses
are all wide of the mark.</p>

<p>By the way, perhaps I should explain why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
I have been selected to write this biography.
The first reason is that I am a free or detachable
electron, and the second point in
my favour is that I have had exceptional
opportunities of seeing about me. I have
heard men say that lookers-on see most of the
game, and as I have witnessed the gradual
evolution of things, you will understand that I
have views of my own. A casual observer
might think that things had deteriorated,
for long ago there were immense monsters
upon this planet, and these would put all
modern creatures in the shade as far as size
and strength are concerned. But one of
the most interesting things to me has been
to watch the evolution of man, and more
especially the gradual development of his
brain. Indeed, sometimes I have wished that
I had happened to be an electron in the brain
of a man; but, on the other hand, my career
would not have been of the varied kind which
it has been.</p>

<p>It was when experimenting with one of
these tubes that a scientist suggested that
radiant particles were being shot across the
tube.</p>

<p>These particles were really electrons, but
it was thought at that time that they were
atoms of matter.</p>

<p>Another scientist declared, from certain
mathematical calculations, that there existed
extremely small particles of something around
the atoms of matter, and that it was the
motion of these in the &aelig;ther which produced
<i>light</i>.</p>

<p>People were not willing to accept this
theory.</p>

<p>Some time later another scientist was able
to prove by experiment that these particles
did exist.</p>

<p>This was done by means of the spectroscope,
as will be related by the electron in a later
chapter.</p></div>

From the little I have told you already of
our experiences, you will see that men had
been making many experiments in which
we electrons took a very active part. It was
disappointing that even although we had
surprised man in so many different ways, he
had never become suspicious of our presence.
One day, however, we did begin to hope for
recognition. I was present, with a great
crowd of electrons, imprisoned within a glass
globe from which the air had been extracted.
We were very pleased to find that the surrounding
space had been cleared of air,
for it was apparent that the experimenter
was going to make us jump across from one
end of the glass tube to the other.</p>

<p>A crowd of us had collected on the extremity
of a wire, or "electrode," at the one
end of the tube, while another similar crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
was present on the other electrode at the
opposite end of the tube. While I speak of a
crowd, meaning that there were millions of us,
I do not suggest that we were overcrowded,
for we had plenty of elbow-room to move
about on the atoms to which we were attached.
All in a moment the scene was changed. We
felt a crowd of electrons pressing us forward
and forcing us right up to the very end of
the electrode. We found that the crowd was
approaching by a wire leading into the tube.
Soon the crowding had reached such a condition
that we became alarmed; we could
see no way of escape. We were imprisoned
by the glass walls, but we soon discovered
that many of the electrons who had been
stationed on the other electrode had deserted
their posts and fled along a wire leading
out of the tube. If we could only follow
them. It would be a tremendous jump to
get over to the other wire, but the way
was fairly clear of air. When the overcrowding
reached a certain point we were
literally shot across from the one electrode
to the other. This was the first time I had
ever experienced anything of the kind, but
many fellow-electrons had gone through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
similar performances for years at the hands
of other experimenters.</p>

<p>However, it was somewhat alarming to be
fired off like a rocket across the tube. What
happened after that I cannot recollect, but
some time later I was present in that or a
similar tube when I heard the experimenter
say to a friend that he believed there were
particles flying across his tube. We sent
news all along the line stating that at last we
had been discovered, and I can assure you
that we felt proud. But our joy was not
long-lived, for it turned out that we were
considered to be particles or atoms of matter;
the experimenter spoke of us as "radiant
matter." This was a real disappointment.</p>

<p>It took us some time to recover from our
disappointment at being mistaken for clumsy
atoms of matter. We are of a higher order
of things altogether. No atom of matter can
travel at speeds such as we can. We cross
these vacuum tubes with speeds equal to
millions of miles per minute.</p>

<p>A great many of us were kept busy within
vacuum tubes by other experimenters, but
nothing very exciting happened. Indeed, we
had lost all hope of attracting man's attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to ourselves as long as we were imprisoned
within these tubes. In the meantime our
hopes were revived by news which reached
us from another quarter.</p>

<p>We heard that a very learned man had
declared boldly that there did exist little
particles which revolved around the atoms
of matter, and that it was the motion of
these tiny particles in the &aelig;ther which produced
the well-known waves of <i>light</i>. There
was considerable rejoicing among us, for we
were anxious to have our services recognised
by man. This great man was not guessing
merely; he was willing to prove by mathematical
calculations that we did exist in
reality. Of course, we ourselves required
no proof of our existence, but we believed
that man would be convinced. Our high
hopes were soon laid low; news reached us
that people were shaking their heads and
saying that figures could be made to prove
anything.</p>

<p>After we had settled down to our ordinary
duties, we got word that at last man had
really detected us in a flame of gas. This
seemed quite reasonable, for, as I shall relate
to you in another chapter, we have a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
lively time of it in a flame of gas. However,
when we were informed that man had discovered
us by means of a sort of telescope
arrangement, I, for one, began to doubt the
truth of the discovery. Some time before
this I had heard that men were spying at
gas flames in the hope of finding us, and this
seemed most ridiculous, for if man could not
see the large congregations of us called <i>atoms</i>,
how could he expect to see individual electrons?
My ignorance was dispelled when it
was explained that man had not been looking
for us directly, but for the &aelig;ther waves which
we produce. But I have not had an opportunity
of explaining to you how some of us
produce waves in the &aelig;ther; I shall have to
wait till a later chapter. In the meantime
I may say that since this important discovery
I have taken some part in an experiment
similar to the historic one wherein we were
detected, but of that too I shall have more to
say again.</p>

<p>The rejoicing at this discovery was not confined
to us, for men of science were quick to
grasp the importance which was attached to
this new knowledge. We felt that man was
bound to acknowledge our services from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
day. The next event was our christening,
and this was not all plain sailing. Indeed,
we have been rather annoyed with one name
which some good friends persist in giving us.
I refer to the name <i>corpuscle</i>, which we feel
to be a sort of nickname, although it may
have been suggested in all kindness. It may
be difficult for you to appreciate our dislike
to this name, but it seems to us to savour too
much of material things. It is not dignified;
you must remember we are not matter. We
are delighted with what we prefer to call our
real name&mdash;electron&mdash;for that speaks of
electricity. As you know, we are units of
particles of negative electricity, and so this
seems a most sensible and suitable name.
But I must hasten to tell of some of our
everyday duties in which we serve man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Personally I knew nothing about marching
until quite recently. Indeed, none of my
fellow-electrons seem to have had definite
ideas of regular marches previous to last
century. That century is prominent in our
history as well as in man's. There is no
doubt that before then we must have made
more or less regular marches through the
crust of the earth and elsewhere; but for
myself I have no such recollection previous
to the following occasion.</p>

<p>The experience was not a very exciting one.
I found myself passing along from atom to
atom in a copper wire. But what was of
special interest to us was that it became
evident that these enforced marches were
being deliberately controlled by man. Of
course you will understand that man knew
nothing of our existence at that time. All he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
knew was that when he placed a piece of zinc
and a piece of copper in a chemical solution,
there were certain effects produced in some
mysterious fashion. For instance, when he
connected the top of the two metals in this
chemical cell or "battery" by a piece of wire,
he got what he described as an <i>electric
current</i>. Now all that happened really was
this. The chemical action in this battery
which man had devised caused a rearrangement
among the atoms composing the metals
and the solution, with the result that we poor
electrons had to rearrange our domiciles. As
an accumulation of electrons gathered on the
zinc, some of us were forced along the
connecting wire towards the copper. As long
as the chemical action in the battery was
kept up, so long were we kept on the march
from the zinc to the copper by way of the
wire.</p>

<p>Man tried increasing the length of this wire
bridge across which we had to pass, but we
had no difficulty in making our way along.
But you must not run away with the idea
that we rush along the wire with lightning
speed. Although we can fly through the
&aelig;ther at a prodigious speed, our progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from atom to atom in a wire is more like a
snail-pace. As a matter of fact, our rate of
march is much less than the walking pace of
a man; indeed it may be stated conveniently
as so many yards per hour.</p>

<p>Some people may find it difficult to believe
that our rate of march is so very slow. Their
front door is a good many yards away from
their electric bell, but it does not take us an
hour, or any appreciable part of a minute,
to summon the maid. The secret is that there
is a whole regiment of us along the wire, and
before one of us moves on to a neighbouring
atom, another electron must move off that
atom and on to its neighbour, and so on. In
this way the electrons at the far end of the
wire commence to move at practically the
same moment as those near the battery.</p>

<p>It has been a source of amusement to me
to see people perfectly mystified by the fact
that they can get no electric current unless
they have a complete circuit. What else could
they expect? How could man march if he
had no road to march on? You see, the reason
for our march is that we wish to escape from
the overcrowding on the zinc, and we are
forced towards the copper. The atoms
com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>posing
the wire are our stepping-stones, and
if there is not a complete chain of atoms we
are helpless. You have already heard how
we can jump an air-space under very great
pressure, but that condition does not exist
in the present case. When we are disturbed
by the chemical action of the battery, we
should prefer to have a short-cut from the
zinc to the copper, but if the only path man
gives us is by way of a long wire, then we
must be content to travel that road, in order
to reach the copper. It is a matter of little
moment to us what arrangement man makes
as long as he gives us a complete path. For
instance, he may lead us out from the zinc
to a distant telegraph instrument, and then,
instead of providing a second wire to take
us back to the battery, he may conduct us
by a short wire to the earth. We are quite
content to lose ourselves in this great reservoir,
provided man places another short
wire from the earth to the copper of the
battery at the other end of the line. Then
as we slip off at the one end of the line, an
equal number of electrons can climb up at
the other end, and thus enable all our friends
in the long wire to keep up a steady march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
This march of ours is not merely a means
of transporting ourselves from one place to
another; it is to enable us to do work. It
is only when we are in motion that we can
do useful work, for we must move before
we can disturb the &aelig;ther, and it is by means
of the &aelig;ther that we transmit energy.</p>

<p>If you place a magnetic needle or mariner's
compass near a wire along which we are
making a steady march, you will find that
we can affect our fellow-electrons who are
stationed within the magnetic needle. We
cause the needle to swing round and take up
a position at right angles to our line of
march. We succeed in doing this because
these electrons in the magnetic needle are
on the move also. But this reminds me that
I have never told you how we produce that
&aelig;ther disturbance which you call <i>magnetism</i>.</p>

<p>When, as children, you played with toy
magnets in the nursery, little did you think
that there was a host of tiny electrons amusing
you. And yet we electrons are responsible
entirely for all magnetic effects, as I shall
proceed to explain.</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER EIGHT</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We believe magnetism to be due to electrons
revolving around atoms of iron and other magnetic
substances, as related by the electron in
this chapter.</p>

<p>We have seen that the steady motion of
electrons along a wire produces a magnetic
field around the wire.</p>

<p>Therefore if we have electrons revolving
round and round the atoms in a piece of iron,
there will be a miniature magnetic field around
each atom.</p>

<p>The electron explains why a piece of iron
does not show the magnetic power locked
up within it until it is "magnetised."</p>

<p>The electron refers to electro-magnets; an
electro-magnet is simply a piece of soft iron
with a coil of insulated wire wound around it.</p>

<p>The iron only shows its magnetic power as
long as a current of electricity is kept passing
through the surrounding coil of wire, for
reasons which the electron explains.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
I may tell you quite frankly that I have
never taken part in the perpetual dance of
which I am about to tell you. I am of a
free and roaming disposition, but I have often
watched some of my fellow-electrons at this
work. Of course, it is pleasant work, as all
our duties are, now that man acknowledges
our services.</p>

<p>We are responsible for the behaviour of
the mariner's compass needle. It is we who
cause it to point continually in one definite
direction. If we ceased to dance around the
iron atoms in the compass needle aboard a
ship, the man at the helm could not tell in
what direction he was going, and sooner
or later he would be almost certain to
wreck his vessel. For this service alone
man ought to be grateful to us, but before I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
have finished my story, you will find that
even this important duty is but a small affair
when compared with many of our other
tasks.</p>

<p>There is one matter I should like to make
quite clear to you. Although we electrons
are all identical, we have different stations
to fill. You have doubtless become familiar
with my roving disposition, and you probably
think of me as a detachable electron. Then
there are our friends who are locked up within
the atoms of matter&mdash;part and parcel of the
atom. And now I am introducing you to
those electrons who act as satellites to the
atoms, revolving around them at a comparatively
great distance, just as the moon revolves
around the earth. These are the electrons
which give rise to the magnetism in a piece
of iron. There are other electrons which
perform very rapid revolutions around all
classes of atoms, but I shall introduce these
friends later on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="position: relative; width: 500px;">

    width="324" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
  <p class="smcap bold center">A Tobacco-Tin Defying Gravitation</p>

  <p>That phenomenon known as "magnetism" is due to the steady
  locomotion of electrons, as explained in the text. Here we see a
  large magnet attracting a tinned iron box which is tethered to
  the table by two cords. The result is that the box is supported
  in the air. The spiral wires are connected to the electro-magnet,
  an explanation of which is given in
  <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>I need hardly remark that a piece of ordinary
iron does not behave like a magnet. Indeed,
it is fortunate that it does not. If it did,
man could not get along with his work very
well. The hammer would stick to the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the nail it had struck, the fire-irons
would stick to the fender, while the cook's
pots and pans would hold on to the kitchen
range. That would be a very stupid arrangement,
but we electrons have really no say
in the matter of arrangement. We are
always on the move, performing a perpetual
dance around the iron atoms, but the atoms
arrange themselves in a higgledy-piggledy
fashion, so that the electrons on one atom
pull the &aelig;ther in one direction while others
pull the &aelig;ther in an opposite direction. In
this way the outward effect is not perceptible.
When, however, man places a coil of wire
around the iron, and makes a crowd of
electrons march along the wire, these marching
electrons affect the &aelig;ther, which in turn
influences the satellite electrons which are
revolving around the atoms of iron. You
may be somewhat surprised when I tell you
that, owing to this &aelig;ther disturbance, these
satellite electrons are able to produce a rearrangement
among the atoms. If you doubt
my word, you may easily prove the truth
of the statement. If you magnetise a
long bar of iron you will find that its
length is actually altered. This is due to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
having disturbed the arrangement of the
atoms.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should explain that when we
force the atoms into their new condition, we
can do so only under the &aelig;ther stress set
up by our fellow-electrons who are marching
in the neighbouring wire. Whenever their
march ceases the &aelig;ther stress is withdrawn,
and the atoms are able to fall back into
their old higgledy-piggledy condition. In
this way man is able to make a piece of
iron a magnet and to unmake it as often
as he cares by simply switching on and off
the electric current from the wire surrounding
the iron.</p>

<p>If a piece of hard steel is used in place of
soft iron, then we find that the atoms are not
so easily disturbed, but when they are once
brought into line with one another, they will
remain in their new condition after the &aelig;ther
disturbance has been withdrawn. It may
seem strange to you that quite a small percentage
of carbon atoms added to the pure
soft iron should cause such a marked difference,
but the matter seems plain enough
to us. Man was so impressed with the
manner in which the atoms were evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
fixed in their new condition that he spoke
of <i>permanent magnets</i>. It is especially fortunate
for man that these pieces of steel do
retain their magnetism, and give us a reliable
mariner's compass. But I shall tell you how
you may disturb even these sedate atoms.
If you hammer the metal very vigorously,
or if you heat it to redness, you will find
that the atoms have been freed from what
appeared to be their permanent position,
and they are back to their old higgledy-piggledy
condition, so that we electrons are
all opposing one another. Remember we
are hard at work all the time although we
may be giving no outward sign of our
activity.</p>

<p>While we render an important aid to man
by providing this permanent magnet for his
compass, you will find that a very great deal
of our assistance to man in his everyday
life depends upon our behaviour in soft iron
electro-magnets. It is in these that man
can control our behaviour at will. It is
through this simple piece of apparatus&mdash;the
electro-magnet&mdash;that man has been able to
accomplish so much in signalling to his friends
at a distance. It is also by means of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
electro-magnets that man can get us to turn
an electric motor, and so on. But I must
tell you, first of all, how we enable man to
signal to a distance, or, in other words, how
we carry man's news.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The electron explains wherein its method
differs from all other methods.</p>

<p>It is well known that within recent years
the old iron telegraph wires have been
replaced by much lighter copper wires; the
electron explains the reason for this change.</p>

<p>It describes how the electrons manage to
work the most widely used form of telegraph
instrument, which is called the "Morse," after
its inventor.</p>

<p>Here we find one of the practical applications
of the electro-magnet described in the
preceding chapter.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
It is we electrons who have so very far outdistanced
all material carriers of news. You
must acknowledge that the best runner, the
swiftest horse, the fastest express train, and
the prize carrier pigeon, are all nowhere when
compared with us electrons.</p>

<p>But I do not wish to mislead you in any way,
and I can speak from personal experience in
this case. We do not race off with man's
messages in the same sense as these other
messengers do. Our swiftness of communication
depends upon the simple fact that man
provides a whole connecting regiment of us
between the two distant places. And when
the order to march is given we all move off at
practically the same moment. In this way
the electrons at the far end of the connecting
wire are able to cause signals there immediately.
This is the secret of man's success in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
being able to hold immediate communication
with his distant friends. His success is due
entirely to the co-operation of us electrons.</p>

<p>My personal experience has been in connection
with a very simple telegraphic
arrangement. Indeed, the most of our duties
in transmitting messages are performed with
this particular kind of instrument, known as
a "Morse sounder."</p>

<p>At the time of which I speak, I had become
attached to an atom of iron in the end of a
long telegraph wire. From this you will
probably guess that my experience was gained
some time ago, for man does not use iron
wires nowadays in fitting up telegraph lines.
He used iron at first, and some of these lines
still exist, but when he discovered that a very
much lighter copper wire would serve the
same purpose, he discarded the heavy iron
wires. Man explained the matter by saying
that the copper offered less resistance to the
electric current, and the majority of people
were quite satisfied with this kind of explanation.
Of course these are merely convenient
phrases which give man no real
reason for the difference. The real reason is
that we electrons are able to move about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
from one copper atom to another with very
much greater ease than we can among the
iron atoms. That is the reason why man
made the change from iron to copper wires,
although he had no idea of the reason at the
time.</p>

<p>To return to my experience in connection
with a telegraph instrument, I found that
we were being subjected to a series of forced
marches. The whole regiment of electrons
along the line made a forward move. The
line of march ended in a short length of fine
wire wound around a piece of soft iron to
form an electro-magnet. The end of the wire
dipped into the earth, as I have explained
in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>Now all that we electrons had to do was
to make a forward move, halt, forward again,
another halt, and so on. Sometimes the
signal to halt was longer in being given than
at other times, but we found that this was
intentional, and that there were two definite
lengths of march. I have explained already
how we marching electrons cause an electro-magnet
to attract a piece of iron and let it
go again as soon as we cease marching.
It only remains for me to give you a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
general statement of how we work the Morse
telegraph.</p>

<p>Man has arranged a little lever with an
iron end-piece immediately above the electro-magnet,
so that the magnet may attract it.
Of course you are aware that it is the electrons
within the soft-iron core of the electro-magnet
who produce the magnetic effect.
Every time we electrons in the surrounding
wire make a forward move, the electro-magnet
pulls down the end of the little lever referred
to. As long as we keep marching, so long
will the end of the lever remain down, but
the moment we halt, the lever is free to be
pulled up by a spring attached to it. The
movements of the lever indicate the length
of our long and short marches, and it is by
means of these that man sends signals. All
that he does is to control our march, by means
of an electric push and a battery at one end
of the wire, and it is we who produce the
signals at the distant end of the wire. Each
time man presses the push we move the
distant lever. When we pull the lever down
it is so arranged that it makes a sound like
"click," and when we let it spring up against
a stop it makes another sound not unlike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
"clack." Our long and short marches are
therefore converted into long and short "click-clacks."
Man has made a simple code of
signals representing his alphabet, and right
merrily do we rap out the signals for which
we receive orders at the distant end of the
wire, while some one at the other end listens
to the sounds we cause to be made.</p>

<p>I have told you enough of our duties to
let you see how we are able to carry man's
news from one part of the earth to any other
part. By far the greatest part of our signalling
work is done with this simple Morse
sounder.</p>

<p>It may interest you to note that we can
produce those signals far faster than man
can read them. When man found this out
he took advantage of our powers. He made
an automatic transmitter which could manipulate
the make-and-break of the battery current
far more rapidly than any human fingers
could do. Then as we rapped off the signals
with lightning speed at the distant end, he
attached a little ink-wheel to the end of
the moving lever, so that it could mark short
and long strokes on a ribbon of paper passing
close to it. Although man could not
dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>tinguish
the signals by his ear he was able
to read the record of those we caused to
be left upon the paper ribbon.</p>

<p>We have been made to work many other
forms of telegraph instruments. In some of
these we control type-letters, while in others
we imitate handwriting, but all these are
merely adaptations of our powers of marching.
We are proud of our achievements in rapid
signalling, which all right-thinking people
have not been slow to acknowledge.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In this chapter the electron deals with
that modern marvel&mdash;<i>Wireless Telegraphy</i>.</p>

<p>Here the &aelig;ther of space plays a very
prominent part.</p>

<p>The author has given some particulars
about the &aelig;ther in the first chapter (<i>What
the Story is about</i>).</p>

<p>In conjunction with that, the electron may
be left to tell its own story.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Our duties in this case are totally different
from those of which I have been telling
you. While we electrons can do many wonderful
things, we cannot march through space.
We may be fired off like bullets from the
sun to the earth, but that is quite another
matter. I shall have something to say about
that fact later on. You have seen already
that man can make us jump only a very short
distance, even when he has cleared our path
of the obstructing air, as he does in a vacuum
tube.</p>

<p>If men were to provide us with a complete
path of metal atoms from the shore to the
ship, we could set to work upon the simple
plan which I have described in the preceding
chapter. But, needless to say, man has more
sense than to attempt to keep up metallic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
connection with a ship going away out to
sea.</p>

<p>Even the wisest men were surprised when
they heard that we electrons could signal
through space to great distances without any
connecting wires. We ourselves were not
surprised. Had we not been doing this very
thing from the foundation of the world? Our
fellow-electrons in the sun have never ceased
to communicate with those of us upon the
earth. Of course I am referring at present
to those &aelig;ther waves which man calls <i>heat</i>
and <i>light</i>. But the waves which we make
to carry man's messages through space are
of the very same nature, the only difference
being that they are much longer, or, in other
words, much farther apart. They do not
follow each other so closely, and they do
not affect the eye or the sense of touch.
However, these long waves are able to bestir
some of us electrons who are situated at a
great distance from the sending electrons.</p>

<p>Our method of producing such waves in
the &aelig;ther is by surging to and fro from
atom to atom in an upright wire. When
we make a rapid to-and-fro motion we
send out great waves in the &aelig;ther. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
original plan adopted by man was to make
us jump across a spark-gap, but in this case
also it was our rapid oscillation to and fro
that produced the waves. If we wish the
waves to carry to a great distance, we must
club together in considerable force to supply
the necessary energy. The energy which we
can get from a battery and induction coil is
not sufficient for any very long distances. In
such cases we require the aid of a <i>dynamo</i>,
a machine about which I shall have some
experience to relate in another chapter.</p>

<p>In communicating through space, our position
is very similar to that of two men shouting
to one another over a distance. The one
man disturbs the air, thus sending air-waves
(sound) over to his friend, and these waves produce
certain sensations which he can interpret.
I should like you to understand that we
electrons are upon a higher plane than atoms
of matter. We cause waves in the all-pervading
&aelig;ther, not among clumsy particles of
air. After these &aelig;ther waves have travelled
enormous distances they retain sufficient
energy to disturb electrons situated at the
distant place.</p>

<p>I shall tell you of the first experience I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
had in this connection. I found myself
attached to an atom of <i>nickel</i>, a kind of atom
which looks to us electrons very much like
an iron atom, because it has nearly the same
number of electrons composing it, only they
are arranged differently. But I was telling
you that I found myself on this nickel atom
sealed up in a small glass tube. Of course
there were myriads of similar atoms all
around me, but I did not feel very happy.
I was being urged forward, and yet I could
not get across from some atoms to others,
for the nickel was in the form of loose
filings. From past experience I knew that
there was a battery along the line somewhere;
I could feel the strain. All of a
sudden I was startled to find that I could
move forward. Exactly what happened, I
am not at liberty to tell, but this much I
may say, that it was the arrival of some
&aelig;ther waves which altered the condition of
things among the filings in the tube.</p>

  <p class="smcap bold center">A Motor-Car with Wireless Telegraph</p>

  <p>It has become quite a fashion in America to have motor-cars
  fitted up for wireless telegraphy. That the electrons play an
  important part in telegraphing through space is explained fully
  in <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>We had just started out on our march
forward when we received such a shaking
that we found ourselves in the same isolated
positions as at first; we could not get across
from one particle to another. More &aelig;ther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
waves arrived, we made a fresh start, then
came another rude shaking, and so on we
went starting and stopping. Indeed, it was
the regularity of these long and short marches
that gave me the first idea that we were
being controlled by some telegraph operator.
We were amused to find that the rude
shaking, of which I have been telling you,
was caused by the action of some of our
fellow-electrons. Some of them in their
march around an electro-magnet in the receiving
instrument caused a little lever to
knock against our tube and give us a sudden
jolt.</p>

<p>I should like you to notice that the energy
with which we moved the telegraph instrument
did not come from the distant station.
It was a local battery which worked the receiving
instrument, but this battery was controlled
by the incoming &aelig;ther waves affecting
the tube of filings. There is really no mystery
about the matter, but I am anxious not to
take credit for anything more wonderful
than we have actually accomplished.</p>

<p>We electrons have rendered a very great
service to man by enabling him to communicate
with his friends who are far out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
on the ocean, and cut off from all possible
chance of material communication. We are
willing to serve man on land also, though
we very much prefer the ordinary marching
arrangement if he will provide a connecting
wire. The fact is that we find it very much
more difficult to send &aelig;ther waves over land
than we do over water.</p>

<p>I have heard some men ask how many
different telegraph instruments may be worked
at one place simultaneously without confusion.
That is a question for man himself to
answer. We electrons are able to produce
any variety of waves of different frequency
or length; it remains only for man to construct
apparatus that will respond only to a
definite rate of waves. I hear that man has
made considerable progress in tuning the
wireless instruments.</p>

<p>Some men are eager to get us to carry
messages through space across the great
oceans from shore to shore. We shall not
refuse, provided man supplies sufficient energy,
but I must admit that we electrons prefer the
submarine cable. Of course man may put this
down to our laziness; we certainly prefer as
little severe straining as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
I have been telling you of my earliest and
only personal experience in connection with
space telegraphy. I understand that greatly
improved methods have been adopted since
that time, but I have never happened to
drift in their direction.</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER ELEVEN</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the first part of this chapter the electron
explains the part it plays in ordinary
telephony.</p>

<p>The reader will picture the transmitting
instrument at the one end of the line influencing

<p>Towards the end of the chapter the electron
turns its attention to the newer subject
of <i>wireless telephony</i>, which has been accomplished
now over a distance of several hundred
miles.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
My scribe suggested a rather clumsy title
for this chapter&mdash;"Electrons <i>versus</i> atoms
as carriers of speech." I expect he made
this suggestion without much thought, for
there are two serious objections to such a
title.</p>

<p>In the first place, we are not carriers of
speech. We are controlled by speech at one
end of the telephone line, and we make a reproduction
of the speech at the distant end
of the line. No sound passes between the
two places; there is only a movement of
electrons along the connecting line.</p>

<p>My second objection to the hurriedly suggested
title is that it is hardly fair to make
any comparison between the achievements
of atoms of matter and those of ourselves.
We are not in the same category as atoms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Besides, we electrons are dependent entirely
upon the material atoms for making our
work useful to man. For instance, we might
keep on making waves in the &aelig;ther for all
time, and yet if the atoms of matter were
to pay no heed to those imperceptible waves,
man would never be aware of their presence.
Indeed we electrons act solely as go-betweens.
On the other hand, it is only fair to ourselves
to point out that a group of atoms in one
town could never communicate with a group
of atoms in a distant town unless we electrons
came to their aid. It is true that over
a very short distance the atoms may communicate
directly. For instance, if a heavy
blow is given to a large gong, the atoms of
metal may vibrate so energetically that they
succeed in disturbing the atoms of gas of the
surrounding atmosphere for some considerable
distance. But in the case of speech,
the speaker cannot supply any great energy,
so that he can disturb the atmosphere only
to a very limited distance. We electrons,
however, can do yeoman service in this
respect. We have enabled men to speak
to one another over immense distances.</p>

<p>The whole affair is very simple. Man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
speaks and causes the atmospheric atoms
to vibrate and impinge upon a light disc
or diaphragm in a simple instrument which
man has named the <i>telephone</i>. This vibrating
disc presses upon a myriad of carbon particles
contained in a small case or box, the disc
forming one side of the box. When these
carbon particles are pressed together we
electrons can get across more easily from
atom to atom. There is a battery urging
us forward, but our motion is dependent
entirely upon the manner in which the
vibrating disc presses upon the carbon particles.
I cannot describe our movement in
the line-wire as a march; it is in reality a
surging to and fro.</p>

<p>You will understand that this to-and-fro
motion of the electrons in the line-wire
varies according to the vibrations of the sending
disc, which is controlled by the speaker's
voice. At the distant end of the line we
electrons bring our magnetic powers into
action. We keep varying the attractive
powers of an electro-magnet, according to
the motion of the electrons in the wire.
This ever-changing magnet produces vibrations
in an iron disc which is fixed close to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the magnet. This disc is set vibrating in
exact sympathy with the sending disc. When
the listener places this receiving disc close to
his ear, the vibrations are carried by the
atmospheric atoms to his hearing apparatus.
All that we electrons have done is to cause
one disc to vibrate in exact synchrony with
another distant disc. But that is all that
is required, for the receiving disc will reproduce
similar air-vibrations to those set
up by the man's voice at the distant place.
I have pointed out already that we do not
attempt to carry the sound. It is true that
the atoms of matter do the hard work, but
it is we electrons who enable a group of
atoms in one town to communicate with a
group of atoms in a distant town.</p>

<p>It was natural that as soon as man found
that he could work his telegraph instruments
without the aid of connecting wires, he should
try to do the same with his telephone instruments.
We were sorry when we found men
trying to use the original spark-telegraphy
methods for telephones. While we had no
difficulty in operating a telegraph instrument
by means of &aelig;ther waves and the tube of filings,
it was quite impossible for us to produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
telephone vibrations on the same principle.
This spark method was a too rough-and-ready
plan. The waves we produced
were like sudden splashes in the &aelig;ther
ocean, whereas we knew that we must produce
regular trains of continuous waves in
order to reproduce telephone vibrations.
However, you may be aware that we have
succeeded by a different arrangement of
apparatus. Indeed it may interest you to
know that one of my most recent experiences
has been in connection with some
wireless-telephone experiments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was not in a very favourable
position to learn all that was going on,
but it was quite exciting work. I happened
to be attached to an atom of copper in a
length of wire which had been run up into
the air on a sort of flag-pole arrangement.
I need hardly say that I was not alone, for
by this time you will have become accustomed
to picture myriads of electrons occupying
a very small space.</p>

<p>We were set vibrating to and fro with
tremendous energy, but what bothered me
most was the great variation in our movements.
It was the nature of these variations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
which gave me the clue that we were being
controlled by the vibrations of a telephone
disc. I can tell you we did make a complex
series of waves in the surrounding &aelig;ther!
These waves went out through space and
influenced some electrons stationed at a great
distance. When these electrons at the receiving
station were set in motion they
controlled the electric current from a local
battery which set a second telephone disc
vibrating in synchrony with the one at the
sending station.</p>

<p>On questioning some of my fellow-electrons
who happened to have been nearer the transmitting
part of the instrument than I had
been, I got some interesting information.
They tell me that there was a dynamo and
an arc lamp in our circuit, while the telephone
instrument was in a neighbouring
circuit. The electrons surging to and fro in
the telephone circuit influenced those energetic
electrons in the arc-lamp circuit to which the
&aelig;rial wire was attached. You see that my
position in the &aelig;rial wire was not a very
advantageous one for observing what was
taking place.</p>

<p>This was truly a great achievement&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
enable one man to speak to another distant
hundreds of miles, and without the aid of
any connecting wire. I think you will agree
with me that we have excelled all past records
in the world of wonders.</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER TWELVE</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here the electron explains its behaviour
in a dynamo at work.</p>

<p>The principle of the dynamo was discovered
by Faraday in the thirties of last century.</p>

<p>He found that when a coil of wire was
moved through a magnetic field, there was a
current of electricity induced in the moving
coil.</p>

<p>Experimental machines were constructed,
and after a while a practical dynamo was
evolved.</p>

<p>Wires are attached to a dynamo and the
electric current is led out.</p>

<p>This current may be conducted to a distant
tramway car, and, by sending the current
through an electric motor, mechanical motion
is produced and the car propelled along.</p>

<p>An electric motor is practically the same
as a dynamo, but instead of turning its coil
round in order to produce an electric current,
we pass a current into the coil and it moves
round. It will be sufficient to leave the
electron to tell its own story.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
This is another of those roving commissions
in which I have been privileged to take part
on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>If you think of the giant size of an electric
tramway car or a railway train, and try to
compare one of these with an electron, such
as your humble servant, it will seem quite
ridiculous that I should suggest that it is
we electrons who move those huge vehicles.
Yet such is the actual case.</p>

<p>Of course we require the application of
very considerable power to urge us to so
heavy a task. All the energy which we can
get from a few electric batteries might enable
us to drive a toy car, but when it comes to
turning the wheels of a real car or train, we
require a correspondingly greater amount of
energy.</p>

<p>I may as well tell you quite frankly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
we electrons are only the intermediaries or
go-betweens. Indeed, you must have noticed
that in every case we act merely as a connecting
link between matter and the &aelig;ther, and
between the &aelig;ther and matter.</p>

<p>But what I want to tell you of, is the part
we play in moving an electric car or railway
train. It is really all very simple if you could
only see it from our standpoint. Picture a
host of us attached to copper atoms in a coil
of wire which is being moved through that
disturbed &aelig;ther called a <i>magnetic field</i>. We
are set in motion immediately. It is true
that when we are moved forward into the
field we march off in one direction, only to
be arrested and made to move off in the
opposite direction as we leave the field, but
it really makes no difference in our working
capabilities as long as we are kept on the
move. This is what is actually taking place
in the armature of a dynamo as it revolves
between the poles of the electro-magnet.
There is no peace for us so long as the coil
is kept revolving; we are kept in a constant
state of rapid to-and-fro motion.</p>

  <p class="smcap bold center">A Train Impelled by Moving Electrons</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that the motion of electrons in an electric
  conductor can result in the movement of heavy vehicles. How this
  comes about is explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This is all we electrons do in a dynamo,
but when the ends of the outer circuit or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
mains are brought into contact with the
ends of our revolving coil, we set the electrons
in the mains surging to and fro in step with
ourselves. Man describes this motion of the
electrons in the mains as an <i>alternating electric
current</i>, but by a simple commutator on the
dynamo he may arrange that we set the
electrons marching in one direction in the
mains. This he describes as a <i>direct electric
current</i>.</p>

<p>It is a matter of indifference to us whether
man drives our coil round by means of a
steam-engine, a water-wheel, or a wind-mill;
all that we electrons want is to be kept
surging or vibrating to and fro. Now you
will be able to appreciate how we electrons
get up sufficient motion to enable us to perform
what I have described as <i>our heaviest
duties</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will find it difficult to believe
me when I tell you that as we march along
the connecting wire to a distant tramway
car we transmit the energy through the
surrounding &aelig;ther, and not through the
wire. This is our mode of working in every
case, whether it be an electric bell, a telegraph,
or telephone. That is to say, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
we electrons move from atom to atom in
the connecting wire, it is the disturbed
&aelig;ther surrounding us which transmits the
energy. You must have realised by this
time how very intimate is the relationship
between ourselves and the &aelig;ther.</p>

<p>To return to the tale of our tramway work,
you will picture my fellow-electrons aboard
the car being energised by the incoming
current. Those electrons present in the
armature coil of the motor are set into
motion, as also are those in the wire of the
neighbouring electro-magnet. The result is
that these two sets of electrons so disturb
the &aelig;ther and affect one another that the
coil is moved round into a different position.
You will remember the experiment of which
I told you, in which a magnetic needle would
insist always in taking up a position at right
angles to a wire in which an electric current
is passing. Well, when the motor coil has
turned into its new position, we electrons
receive an impulse from our friends in the
line-wire which causes us to retrace our steps
in the coil. This action of ours causes the
coil to make a further movement in the
same direction as at first. Again we change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
our direction of march, and again the coil
changes its position towards the electro-magnet.
The sole duty of these electrons in
the armature coil is to keep surging to and
fro, while those electrons in the electro-magnet
keep up a steady march in one direction.
This arrangement necessitates the
armature coil to keep changing its position
continually, and when we have the armature
coil spinning round at a steady pace, it is
easy for man to connect the armature to
the axles of the tramway car and cause us
to drive the wheels round.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that it makes no difference
to us whether we are asked to drive a tramway
car, a railway train, or a host of machines
in a factory or workshop. All that we
electrons in the motor require is to have
sufficient energy passed along to us from our
fellows in the distant dynamo. Again I
admit frankly that the atoms of matter play
a very important part in these our heaviest
duties, but you will see that without our
active assistance they could not transmit the
necessary energy to a distant car or train.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While it has been known for a long time
that <i>light</i> and <i>radiant heat</i> are merely waves

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Every living thing is dependent upon our
activities. It is we electrons who send out
heat and light from the sun, and it is we
who receive these on their arrival upon this
planet. Our action in the matter is really
very simple, but until man discovered our
existence, he was mystified considerably.</p>

<p>We were amused to hear man say that
the atoms of incandescent matter in the
sun produced waves in the &aelig;ther, and that
when these &aelig;ther waves fell upon other
atoms on this planet, these were set into a
state of vibration, thus producing heat and
light. Now if man had only stopped to think,
he would have seen how ridiculous it was
to speak of atoms of matter producing waves
in the &aelig;ther. He ought to have known that
atoms of matter cannot affect the &aelig;ther,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
for it offers no resistance to matter moving
through it.</p>

<p>Man might have pictured himself riding
on the back of this great planet, flying through
space at a speed very similar to that of a
rifle bullet, and yet even the flimsy blanket
of air surrounding the planet is not disturbed
by the &aelig;ther through which it is
rushing.</p>

<p>It is true that the atoms of matter play an
important part in the origin of heat, but the
atoms in the sun could no more affect the
atoms on the earth than could a man on the
earth push the moon about. It is the very
intimate connection between us electrons and
the all-pervading &aelig;ther which enables our
fellows in the sun to communicate with those
of us upon this planet. Where would man be
without us?</p>

  <p>When a man is encased completely in an over-all made of flexible
  metallic gauze he is proof against shock due to a discharge of
  high-tension electricity. The part played by electrons in the
  case of electric shock is explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter
  IV</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot understand wherein man should
find any mystery in connection with this very
simple action of ours. You will picture our
distant fellow-electrons making very rapid
revolutions around the atoms of matter to
which they are attached as satellites. Just
as the moon circles around the earth, so do
we circle around our atoms, but at an
enor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>mously
greater speed. Of course the whole
length of our orbit is inconceivably small, and
the speed of our revolutions is inconceivably
great. It is our rapid motion through the
&aelig;ther which produces those waves known to
man as radiant heat and light. Some one
may ask how it is that we electrons can
disturb the &aelig;ther while the giant atoms
cannot. The obvious answer is that we are
not matter, but electricity; we are not in the
same category as atoms of matter.</p>

<p>To complete the picture which I was drawing,
you have only to think of the &aelig;ther
waves arriving upon this planet and disturbing
sympathetic electrons, causing them
to revolve around their atoms in similar
fashion to our distant fellows who are producing
the &aelig;ther waves.</p>

<p>It may be that some people get confused
between this action and that of those electrons
who are shot off bodily from the sun towards
the earth. Believe me, there is no connection
between the two things. The stream
of electrons shot off from the sun is deflected
towards the magnetic poles of the earth, and
as the electrons enter the upper layers of
the atmosphere they produce that beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
luminous effect which man describes as an
<i>Aurora</i>.</p>

<p>I have never taken part in one of these
great displays, for, as far as my recollection
goes, I have never been in the sun, although
some fellow-electrons declare that at one time
we were all in the same great glowing mass
of which the sun, and every member of the
solar system, formed a part. However that
may be, I certainly have no experience of
auror&aelig;, but I have assisted in producing the
very same effect upon a small scale within a
vacuum tube. The air remaining in these
so-called vacuum tubes is just as rarified as
the air in the upper layers of the atmosphere,
and when we are shot across the tube we
act in the same way as those electrons
arriving upon this planet from the sun.</p>

<p>You will observe that as a surplus of electrons
arrives upon the earth from the sun,
the earth is naturally a negatively electrified
body, but I need hardly say that the earth
does not keep all the electrons which arrive
upon it.</p>

<p>My scribe points out that I am wandering
from the story which I set out to tell in
this chapter, so I shall try and please him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
The direct cause of light, whether it be
natural or artificial, is the rapid motion of
electrons around atoms of matter. If they
revolve at a comparatively slow speed they
produce those &aelig;ther waves which man calls
<i>radiant heat</i>. If these satellite electrons, however,
desire to affect the eye of man, they
have to move around at a very much greater
speed. If we travel at too fast a speed, then
we cease to cause the sensation of light. But,
believe me, all the waves we make are of
the same nature, no matter what names man
has given them. The only difference we can
make in the waves is the rate at which they
follow one another. Of course we can also
make them larger or smaller in height, or, in
other words, of greater or less amplitude, but
that does not affect their properties.</p>

<p>In the following chapter I shall tell you
of some remarkable phenomena which our
different &aelig;ther waves produce in the brain
of man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
In the preceding chapter I have been telling
you how we electrons produce waves in the
&aelig;ther ocean. I pointed out that if we make
the waves follow each other at too slow or too
fast a rate they fail to affect man's eyes.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to you that only a
very small range of our &aelig;ther waves should
affect man's visionary apparatus. Of course
this limitation lies beyond our province; we
can produce endless variety of &aelig;ther waves&mdash;it
is man's organs which fail to appreciate the
bulk of these. However, there is plenty of
variety in the sensations which we can produce
in man. If we make the waves follow
each other at a certain speed, man says he
has the sensation of <i>red</i>. If we move faster,
he speaks of <i>orange-colour</i>, and as we increase
our speed he names his further sensations as
<i>yellow</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>, and <i>violet</i>. Then if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
combine all these waves&mdash;that is, if we produce
them all at one time&mdash;he says he has the
sensation of <i>white</i>. If we produce none of
these waves, he calls the result <i>black</i>.</p>

<p>While we electrons are very versatile, our
actions are dependent in a great measure
upon circumstances. For instance, if an electron
is acting as a satellite to one particular
kind of atom, its rate of revolution around
that atom may be very different from that of
an electron similarly attached to another kind
of atom. We electrons are all identical, but
the speed of revolution is determined by the
kind of atom. The reason is very simple;
electrons revolve around some atoms at a
much greater distance than they would
around other atoms. Those making only the
smaller orbits not only get around their
atoms in less time, but they are also travelling
at a greater pace. It is this fact which
enables the electrons to produce the various
wave-lengths which stimulate the different
colour sensations in the brain of man.</p>

<p>I think you will have no difficulty in seeing
how it is that we come to produce such a
variety of wave-lengths&mdash;in other words,
how we are able to make the waves follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
each other more or less rapidly. You will
understand that we do not produce colours;
we merely make various waves in the &aelig;ther,
and these waves excite the colour sensations
in man. I mention this simple fact, because
I hear many people speaking of our &aelig;ther
waves as "coloured rays," which, of course, is
quite a ridiculous description.</p>

<p>Suppose some of those waves which give
rise to the red sensation happen to fall upon
a lump of matter which contains only electrons
capable of producing waves that affect the
green sensation. What will happen? There
will be no response, and the object, although
viewed by "red light," will appear black.</p>

<p>If an object, such as the white paper upon
which my scribe is recording my story, contains
a variety of atoms with electrons capable of
revolving at all the different rates which
produce colour sensations, then when "white
light" falls upon the object it appears white
(all the colour sensations combined). If, on
the other hand, a "red light" only falls upon
it, then only the electrons capable of responding
to that rate of wave will be set in motion,
and the object will appear red, and so on
with the other rates of &aelig;ther waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
So far I have been telling you what happens
when different waves of light fall upon us.
Now I shall endeavour to explain how man
has caused us to produce artificial light. At
present all man's methods in this direction
are dependent upon making some substance
so hot that it becomes incandescent. Even
his most modern methods seem to us to be
ridiculously wasteful and most roundabout. I
shall speak only of the electric glow lamp, as
I have had some experience in connection
with this.</p>

<p>On one occasion I had been taking part
in a regular forward march from copper atom
to copper atom in a conducting wire. I had
no idea of the purpose of our march till I
suddenly found myself handed over to some
carbon atoms, who were in a very lively state
of vibration. We had much more difficulty
in making our way through this substance,
and it was the passive resistance offered to the
advance of the electrons who had preceded
me that had driven the carbon atoms into
this state of great excitement. In our march
through the copper conductor we had been
offered very little resistance, so that we had
left the copper atoms in peace&mdash;at least man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
could not detect easily any excitement (heat).
But so long as our forced march was maintained
among the carbon atoms, so long did
the high temperature exist.</p>

<p>You will understand I and the other marching
electrons did not produce the waves of
light sent out by the glow lamp. What we
did was to set the atoms of carbon into
a rapid vibratory state, and they in turn
caused their satellite electrons to hasten their
pace. Some electrons produced one rate of
waves, and some another rate, but by the
time the carbon was incandescent there were
electrons sending out all the variety of wave-lengths,
the combination of which produces
the sensation of white.</p>

<p>I have accused man of adopting very wasteful
processes, so I had better explain the
matter. In the preceding description of what
is occurring in an electric glow lamp, I have
spoken only of those &aelig;ther waves which
constitute light. But there are myriads of
electrons in the carbon of the glow lamp
that never attain the requisite speed to produce
those waves; they revolve around their
atoms at too slow a rate. They certainly
disturb the &aelig;ther, but the crests of the waves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
are so far apart that they do not affect the
eyes of man. The business of these waves
is to set up heat in the bodies upon which
they fall. You may be surprised to know
that in this contrivance of man, called an
electric glow lamp, and, indeed, in all his
other artificial light-producers, he causes far
more electrons to produce radiant heat than
the desired light waves. A most wasteful
process!</p>

<p>Man has a long way to travel yet before
he succeeds in producing artificial light by
a reasonable process. Indeed I doubt if any
of you can realise, as we do, how exceedingly
stupid the existing methods are. Think for
a moment of the glow-worm, in which we
electrons produce light without setting up
any wasteful heat waves. There is a strong
contrast between this peaceful plan and that
of the excited carbon atoms. When will man
succeed in discovering this secret of ours?</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER FIFTEEN</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is remarkable that man has been able to
discover what the distant stars are made of.</p>

<p>Our knowledge concerning the chemistry
of the stars has been obtained by means of
the spectroscope, in which a beam of light
from the star is passed through a glass
prism.</p>

lines appear, according to the distant
elements originating the &aelig;ther waves.</p>

from its own point of view.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
It is only within recent times that man has
observed that we send messages from the distant
stars to this planet. But there is nothing
new to us in this proceeding; we have
been busy sending these messages ever since
the solar system was formed. Through all
those ages we have kept on sending these
messages, knowing that in time man must
come to take notice of them.</p>

<p>If the subject should happen to be new to
you, you will be anxious to know to what
kind of messages I refer. Needless to say,
they are wireless messages&mdash;waves in the
great &aelig;ther ocean. The waves, to which I
refer specially, fall within that small range
of which I told you something in the preceding
chapter. In other words, they are
those waves to which man has given the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
name <i>light</i>. But what special information do
these waves, coming from the stars, convey
to man? They tell him of what materials
these distant stars are made. Needless to
say, it is we electrons who produce those
informative waves.</p>

<p>You are familiar with our method of producing
waves. You know that we whirl
around the atoms of matter at prodigious
speeds, and that according to the number of
revolutions we make per second, we produce
waves of corresponding frequencies.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter I have hinted that the
speed of the revolving electron is determined
by the kind of atom to which it acts as a
satellite. For instance, when electrons revolve
around iron atoms they produce certain
wave-lengths, while those moving around
hydrogen atoms produce an entirely different
series of waves. But how is man to recognise
these?</p>

<p>It is quite evident that man may gaze at a
distant star and be little the wiser concerning
the different lengths of the waves which
impinge upon his eyes. He may observe
that the sensation is inclined to red, from
which he may infer that the waves are long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
ones&mdash;that they are farther apart than some
of the waves produced by a white-hot body.
But had man been content to try and decipher
our wireless messages in this rough-and-ready
manner, he would never have
gained the interesting information which we
have now placed in his hands. How, then, did
we enable man to read our messages?</p>

<p>Our plan may seem to be somewhat mysterious,
but I assure you that it is really very
simple. When these &aelig;ther waves of light
fall upon a triangular prism of glass, the
waves are bent out of their normally straight
path. But the point that may seem strange
to you, is that those waves which produce the
sensation of red are not bent so much as the
others. The more rapidly the waves follow
one another, the greater is the bending of
such a ray from its original direction. In
this way the various wave-lengths are all
spread out, so that they form an image like
a coloured ribbon, red at one end, being followed
by orange, yellow, green, blue, and
violet. Every man must be familiar with
this coloured spectrum. When some of my
fellows are enclosed in drops of water in the
air they produce a great rainbow spectrum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
across the heavens. But I must tell you how
we electrons succeed in bending these rays of
light.</p>

<p>I have told you already how we either
absorb or reflect the &aelig;ther waves which
happen to fall upon us. In most substances
it is only those electrons very near the surface
that are disturbed. They succeed in stopping
the waves. They may do this in either of two
different ways. If the satellite electrons are
attracted strongly by their atoms, the electrons
will spin around the atoms keeping time
to the movements of the incoming waves, and
in this way the electrons take up the energy
of the waves. In doing this, the electrons
send out fresh waves in the &aelig;ther. This is
the real explanation of what man calls <i>reflection</i>
of light.</p>

    width="351" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
  <p class="smcap bold center">The Spectroscope and the Electrons' Wireless Messages</p>

  <p>The spectroscope is seen in the extreme left of No. 1 photograph.
  The instrument is explained at <a href="#Page_207">page 207</a>.</p>

  <p>The operator is passing an electric current through a glass tube
  containing a rarefied gas, causing the gas to become luminous.
  When he examines its light through the spectroscope he sees
  bright lines as shown in photograph No. 2, and from the position
  of these lines he can tell what substance is producing the light.
  No. 2 is the spectrum of mercury vapour. No. 3 is part of the
  spectrum of the sun. Note the dark lines, as explained in the
  text.</p>
</div>

<p>In the second case, the electrons are not so
firmly attached to their atoms, so that the
incoming waves dislodge them, and they are
knocked about from atom to atom, and in
this way the energy of the waves is frittered
away. Man speaks of the light having been
<i>absorbed</i> by the substance upon which it fell.
In both cases the only electrons which take
part in these actions are those electrons who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
can move in sympathy with the incoming
waves.</p>

<p>It will be clear to you that only those of us
who are near the surface of a substance know
anything about these incoming waves. The
electrons attached to atoms in the interior of
the substance are left in peace, owing to the
defensive actions of our fellows on the outside.
But this is not the case with all substances.
There are some congregations of
atoms through which the &aelig;ther waves can
make their way. Man calls such materials
<i>transparent</i>; for example, glass and water
are transparent substances. The fact of the
matter is that in such substances none of us
are able to respond to the incoming waves, and
so we cannot stop them. I should say almost
none of us, for there are always a few electrons
present who happen to be in sympathy with
the incoming waves. That is why no substance
is perfectly transparent.</p>

<p>The point concerning which I wish to speak
in particular is this. Although we allow the
&aelig;ther waves to pass through such substances,
we do offer some slight resistance to the passage
of the waves; the faster the to-and-fro
motion of the waves, the more resistance do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
we offer. That is why the waves of highest
frequency are bent farthest from the straight
line when passed through a glass prism.
We actually force the &aelig;ther waves to travel
slower through a piece of glass than through
the air.</p>

<p>Now there should be no mystery concerning
our action in a triangular piece of glass.
Whatever combination of &aelig;ther waves falls
upon it, the different trains of waves are
sorted out according to their frequencies.
Suppose, for instance, that &aelig;ther waves
emitted from some incandescent sodium are
passed through a glass prism. The bulk of
the electrons attached to the sodium atoms
are capable of revolving at speeds which produce
waves causing the sensation of yellow.
Hence there will appear a very distinct line of
yellow light in the spectrum. But why
should the light be in the form of a line?
Simply because our &aelig;ther waves are passed
through a narrow slit in a shutter. But I
need not trouble you with further details of
our actions, which, although very simple to
us, may seem somewhat strange to you.</p>

<p>You will understand, however, that we
form bright lines in different parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
spectrum, according to the kinds of atoms to
which we are attached. It was this fact
which attracted man's attention to our wireless
messages. He soon discovered the meaning
of these lines, for he commenced to take
exact notes of the different positions in which
we placed these lines. He saw that when we
were attached to hydrogen atoms we always
produced three prominent lines; a very distinct
line in the red section, another in the
blue part, and a third one somewhat fainter
and farther along in the blue. On the other
hand, when attached to sodium atoms, we
produced two very distinct lines in the yellow.
When attached to iron atoms we produced a
great variety of lines in the spectrum. Of
course these substances have to be incandescent
to enable us to produce the &aelig;ther
waves.</p>

<p>Now it will be clear to you how we send
wireless messages from the distant stars.
These stars are great masses of flaming gases,
so that the satellite electrons are kept busy
dancing attendance to excited atoms. The
electrons are constantly sending out &aelig;ther
waves, which reach this planet. We sort out
these waves when man passes them through a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
glass prism, mounted in a telescope arrangement
which he calls a <i>spectroscope</i>. He then
examines the positions of the lines we produce
in the resulting spectrum, and from these he
knows what kinds of atoms are present in the
distant star. It is we who have informed
man that there are forty different materials
in the sun, the most common of which are
hydrogen, sodium, iron, copper, nickel, and
zinc. Of course these all exist in a gaseous
form.</p>

<p>There is one point about which I need
hardly trouble you, although it is worth
mentioning in passing. While we produce
bright lines in the spectrum of any incandescent
substance on this planet, our messages
from the stars appear as dark lines. The
reason for this is that there are cooler masses
of the gases surrounding the incandescent
masses forming the stars, and these cooler
gases completely absorb the waves we produce.
So completely are these waves absorbed
that blank spaces are left in the
spectrum, and these are the dark lines to
which I refer. As they are in the same positions
that the bright lines would have occupied
had the waves reached the earth, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
makes no difference to the reading of our
messages.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, some of our actions in
forming lines in the spectrum led to our
actual discovery by man; but I shall tell you
of this in the following chapter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Several men of note declared that "little
particles" revolved around the atoms of

particles which produced the well-known

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
We electrons had waited long ages for man
to acknowledge our services, but we did not
despise the acknowledgment which a few
men accorded us upon the basis of their
mathematical calculations. It was natural,
however, that we should want something
more definite than this.</p>

<p>You can imagine our joy when real experimental
proof of our existence was established.
Perhaps you think that we should
have been satisfied with this. But even this did
not bring acknowledgment from many outside
scientific circles, and not even from all
within those circles. As our services to man
are universal, we feel that all men should
become acquainted with our doings. Indeed
that was the chief argument used by my
fellow-electrons, who urged me to write this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
autobiography. The story of our actual discovery
by man is an interesting one.</p>

<p>It all came about in a very simple manner,
but in quite a different way from what most
electrons expected. Man reasoned within
himself that if we electrons really did revolve
around atoms and thus produce waves in the
&aelig;ther, as had been suggested, he ought to
be able to affect our movements by disturbing
the &aelig;ther in which we were revolving. Of
course man cannot disturb the &aelig;ther directly;
he must employ some of us to do this for
him. He caused us to produce a very powerful
magnetic field, which, as you know, is a
disturbance of the &aelig;ther. Man did not bother
thinking about <i>us</i> in this connection; he
simply sent an electric current around an
electro-magnet, but I have explained to you
the very active part we play in electric and
magnetic actions.</p>

<p>From my story in the preceding chapter,
you are aware that man had observed the
meaning of the bright lines in the spectrum
of any incandescent body. When he examined
the &aelig;ther waves we send out from sodium
atoms, he found two very distinct lines in
the yellow. Because of the brightness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
these lines, man selected a sodium flame to
experiment with in the present case.</p>

<p>You will picture a great host of my fellow-electrons
revolving around the atoms in a
sodium flame. The flame was placed between
the poles of a very powerful electro-magnet,
and a beam of &aelig;ther waves (light) produced
by us was directed into the spectroscope.
The experimenter focussed all his attention
upon one of the bright yellow lines. He
noted very carefully the exact position in
which we placed it. He then produced the
magnetic field around the flame, in which
my fellow-electrons were revolving at a steady
pace, and, behold, the line which he was
watching split up into two lines, one taking
up a position a little higher up the spectrum
scale, and the other going a little lower down
towards the red end. What could this
mean?</p>

<p>Man had no difficulty in knowing the cause
of this alteration; indeed, it was exactly what
he had hoped would take place. Of the two
new lines, one represented waves a little
shorter, while the other line indicated waves
a little longer or farther apart, than the
original waves forming the single line. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
could only come about by some of the electrons
having had their rate of revolution increased,
while that of others had been reduced. These
alterations were due to the &aelig;ther disturbance
(the magnetic field). Those electrons whose
orbits happened to lie in one position had
their rate of revolution increased, while those
whose orbits lay in another position had their
speed reduced. Man was convinced at last
that we "particles" were real existing things.</p>

<p>Whenever man withdrew the &aelig;ther disturbance,
the electrons fell back into their
natural rate of revolution, and the original
single line appeared in the spectrum.</p>

<p>I took no part in the original experiment
which gave absolute proof of our existence,
but since then I have been present in a
laboratory when the same experiment has
been repeated.</p>


<p>This is not the only case in which we
alter the positions of definite lines in the
spectrum. Indeed, we have given man some
interesting information about the motions of
distant stars&mdash;information which he could
not have obtained in any other way. We
have sent wireless messages from distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
stars, indicating that they were approaching
the earth, while electrons aboard other stars
have signalled that they are receding from
the earth. All this may seem mysterious to
you, and yet our actions in the matter are
very simple. Indeed, we do nothing but what
I have told you of in the preceding chapters.
We send out definite wave-lengths in the
manner described already. But if we are
on board a star which is travelling towards
the earth, our waves will naturally follow
a little closer at each other's heels. On the
other hand, if the star is receding from the
earth, the waves must be a little farther
apart than they would be if the star were
at rest.</p>

<p>You will understand that the electrons are
revolving at the same speeds in both cases,
but the forward movement of the star crowds
the waves together, while a receding star
stretches them out a little farther apart.
The result at the receiving end is that the
crowded waves are just as though they had
come from electrons revolving at a greater
speed than is actually the case. Hence the
line appears farther along the spectrum, up
the scale of frequencies, than would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
been the case had the star not been moving
forward in the line of sight. Thus if the
hydrogen lines, of which I have spoken elsewhere,
should appear higher up the spectrum
than usual, then man knows that the star
from which these waves are coming is approaching
the earth.</p>

<p>It will be evident that when known lines
in the spectrum are shifted down the scale
(towards the red end of the spectrum), then
the rate of the waves has been decreased,
and man knows that the star carrying these
stimulating electrons is receding from him.</p>

<p>You will observe that we electrons perform
no new duty in connection with this matter;
it is entirely the motion of the body carrying
us that alters the positions of the lines. But
I must hasten on to tell you of some personal
experiences.</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The present generation were all very much
interested in the discovery of X-rays.</p>

<p>With the aid of a battery and an induction
coil, man causes an energetic electrical discharge
to pass through a vacuum tube.</p>

<p>When the flying electrons strike upon a
little metal target placed in their path, they
produce the well-known Roentgen rays.</p>

<p>We have all become familiar with the great
penetrating powers of these rays.</p>

<p>The electron may be left to tell its own
story.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
It was no surprise to us that we could produce
what man calls X-rays, but we were
very much surprised at the use to which
man put these splashes which we made in
the &aelig;ther. A limited number of us had been
producing X-rays on our own account for
many ages, but I shall tell you of that in
a later chapter, when you will hear how we
made the world talk.</p>

<p>I must tell you of my own experiences in
connection with these X-rays, which I hear
some men describe also as <i>Roentgen rays</i>.
I found myself once more within a large
vacuum tube, and as soon as I felt a crowd
of my fellows pushing me forward, I was
quite prepared to be shot across the tube,
as on previous occasions. Personally, I was
not prepared for what was to come. Just
as we reached the centre of the tube we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
collided with a metal plate or target. It
was no joke to be pulled up so suddenly
when travelling at a terrific speed. I noticed
at the time that our very sudden stoppage
had a peculiar effect upon the &aelig;ther. Of
course we never bothered about a name for
this disturbance; it is man who requires to
have names for everything. He was quite
right to call this &aelig;ther disturbance "X-rays,"
for even now he does not know the real
nature of these. I have heard him describe
them as thin pulses in the &aelig;ther, but there is
something more.</p>

<p>I may as well confess that although we
observed this &aelig;ther disturbance arising from
our sudden stoppage, we paid little attention
to it, until it became apparent that man
was continuing to produce these rays for
some special purpose. He had discovered that
we could shoot these rays right through many
solid substances which were not transparent
to light. But I have not told you how man
came to know that we could produce these
penetrating rays.</p>

<p>On one occasion we were sending out these
rays, which, by the way, do not cause any
sensation in man's visionary apparatus. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
room was in darkness. Some of the invisible
rays fell upon a collection of small
chemical crystals which were fixed on the
surface of a screen. Our fellow-electrons,
who were attached to the atoms of the
crystals, were bestirred into action. They
could not reflect the X-rays, but they set
up regular trains of waves in the &aelig;ther, some
of which came within the range that affects
man's vision. Man knew that this chemical
screen could not produce light on its own
account, and it became apparent that the
vacuum tube must be sending some &aelig;ther
waves towards the chemical screen.</p>

<p>As the electrons on the screen produced
an &aelig;ther disturbance different from that
which fell upon it, man called this a <i>fluorescent
screen</i>.</p>

<p>At first we took merely a passing interest
in the experiments which man made with
these X-rays of ours, for it seemed to us as
though man thought them only good enough
for amusing his friends. Indeed, we paid
little heed to what he was doing, until we
observed that the rays were being used by
surgeons. We were interested at once, for
here we could serve man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
My first experience in this connection was
quite interesting. A young girl had got a
needle into her hand while she was playing
about, and the surgeons were at a loss to
know where the needle had lodged. We lost
no time in producing X-rays which could
penetrate the flesh of the hand, and reach
the fluorescent screen on the other side. The
bones of the hand blocked the way of our
rays, but not so completely as the needle did.
Hence we produced upon the screen a faint
shadow of the flesh of the hand, a much
deeper image of the bones, and a black shadow
of the needle. This enabled the surgeon to
see where the needle was hiding.</p>

<p>Sometimes we were called upon to produce
rays for detecting bullets in the flesh,
or for showing the nature of a fractured bone.
We were never surprised to find that our call
was to detect a coin in the throat of a child,
but in this connection a big surprise awaited
some of us. I was not one of the party, but
I have the information from some fellow-electrons.</p>

  <p class="smcap bold center">How Electrons Produce X-Ray Images</p>

  <p>The upper photograph shows the X-ray apparatus in use. The
  operator is examining the bones of the lady's hand, which she
  places between the X-ray tube and the fluorescent screen. The
  rays pass through the flesh, but are obstructed by the bones, the
  rings, and the bangle, so that a shadowgraph or image is formed
  upon the screen, which becomes luminous where the rays succeed in
  reaching it. The actual examination is made in a dark room. Owing
  to the way X-ray photos are taken (by contact) the image is
  reversed in a photograph, so that a left looks like a right
  hand.</p>
</div>

<p>A party of electrons were present within
an X-ray tube at a large hospital, when
they were called upon to produce rays for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
examining the throat of a little girl. They
had become so used to this call that they
did not doubt there would be a coin in the
child's throat. However, they lost no time
in producing the penetrating rays, and you
can imagine their surprise when they produced
the image of a toy bicycle upon the
screen. It seemed ridiculous that such a toy
could have entered a child's throat.</p>

<p>When we had shown the surgeons exactly
where the toy was, they set to work to
remove it. The electrons heard later that
the operation was successful in every way.
Every one was interested, and we were
proud. I do not wish to appear boastful, but
I wonder how many operations owe their
success to these rays which we produce for
man.</p>

<p>It was natural that man should try if these
searching rays could affect the chemicals upon
a photographic plate, and we soon proved
that they could. It made no difference to us
whether man kept the plate sealed up in its
light-proof envelope, or whether he placed
the plate within a wooden box. These protecting
covers offered no barrier to our rays.
We produced shadowgraphs of any objects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
placed between our tube and the photographic
plate.</p>

<p>Two of my early experiences may be of
interest to you. The first of these seemed
to me a rather tame affair. Our X-ray tube
appeared to be arranged for the amusement
of fashionable folk. One grand lady placed
her hand behind the fluorescent screen, whereupon
we produced an image of the bones of
her hand and very dark images of all the
many rings upon her fingers. Several of the
rings had enormous diamonds, but it was
after she had gone away that I overheard
two gentlemen speaking about the rings.
One asked the other if he had observed the
beautiful diamonds, whereupon the other
roared with laughter. It seems that we
proved them to be imitation diamonds, for
our rays could not penetrate them, whereas
they have no difficulty in passing through
real diamonds. We therefore produced black
shadows of the imitation diamonds. Little
did the grand lady know how we had exposed
her sham jewels.</p>

<p>My second experience was a very curious
one. I learned that our tube was being
carried to some distance. After a while we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
were placed beside a peculiar-looking object,
which the men referred to as the "mummy."
One of the men suggested that they should
photograph its feet, but before doing so
they darkened the room and set us to work
upon the fluorescent screen. The owner of
the mummy got rather nervous as to what
we might disclose, and as the force urging
us into action was somewhat erratic at first,
we produced only a very indistinct image.
We were greatly amused at the nervous excitement
of the owner; he seemed to think
our verdict was that there were no bones.
However, the man with the apparatus soon
got things into better condition, and this
enabled us to produce X-rays satisfactorily.
The result was that they secured some excellent
photographs of the hidden bones of the
mummy.</p>

<p>Before telling you how we made the world
talk, I should like to give you a clear idea of
our relationship to the atoms of matter.</p>

electrons.</p>

<p>These electrons, being negative particles of

I am sorry that this part of my story must
remain incomplete for the present. I am not
free to tell you all I know; you must try and
get behind the scenes on your own account.</p>

<p>One thing I am at liberty to tell you is that
my fellow-electrons who are locked up within
the atoms are not without hope that they
may gain their freedom once more at some
future time. I know this first-hand, for I
have met some fellow-electrons who have
escaped from within an atom, but I shall
delay telling you about these fellows till the
succeeding chapter. My object in mentioning
this fact now is to give you confidence in what
I am about to say regarding the nature of the
atom.</p>

<p>On one occasion I overheard a conversation
between two men who were discussing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
construction of matter. One remarked that
the atoms were the bricks of the universe,
whereupon the other asked how the little
bricks were cemented together. I wish that
man could have seen a lump of matter as we
see it. He would have been surprised to learn
that the atoms never really touch each other.
They are always surging to and fro, or
<i>vibrating</i>, and it is this motion which constitutes
the <i>temperature</i> of the body which
they compose.</p>

<p>It must be clear, however, that in a solid
body one atom attracts another atom across
the intervening atomic spaces. This is another
duty devolving upon us; what we do, really,
is to upset the electric balance between the
different atoms, and thus produce electrical
attraction.</p>

<p>First of all, perhaps, I should explain that
the different kinds of atoms are simply congregations
of different numbers of electrons.
Of course there is the other part, of which
I am forbidden to speak&mdash;the part which man
vaguely describes as <i>positive electricity</i>. However,
you may take it from me that while it is
true that the main difference between an atom
of gold and an atom of iron, or of oxygen, is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the number of electrons it contains, there is a
very important difference in the arrangement
of the electrons. You know that they form
rings outside one another, all of which revolve
at enormous speeds. The number of electrons
in the different rings varies according to the
kind of atom.</p>

<p>It is quite correct for man to speak of the
atoms containing certain definite numbers of
electrons, but I should like you to understand
clearly that the exact number of electrons is
not permanently fixed; one or more electrons
can slip off one atom and become attached to
a neighbouring atom which happens to be
capable of accepting it or them. It is the
interchange of these few detachable electrons
that causes one atom to attract another. In
other words, it is the differently charged atoms
which attract each other, just as man crowds
a surplus of electrons on to one object and
finds it attracted bodily towards another object
having a deficiency of electrons.</p>

<p>It is this electrical attraction between the
atoms which enables us to build up the particles,
or <i>molecules</i>, of matter in such a variety
of forms. First of all, we play the most important
part within the atoms. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
formed only a limited number of such atoms.
I am not free to tell you exactly how many,
for man has discovered only about eighty of
these different congregations of electrons,
each kind of which he calls an <i>element</i>. The
way in which we have coupled these different
elementary atoms together must appear remarkable
to all thinking men; there seems to
be no end to the possible variety of combinations.</p>

<p>In one case we unite an atom of <i>chlorine</i> to
an atom of <i>sodium</i> and thereby produce a
molecule of common salt. In another case
we unite an atom of <i>oxygen</i> to two atoms of
<i>hydrogen</i>, and the resulting combination is
an invisible molecule of ordinary water.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me very strange
how some men have difficulty in regard to
these combinations. I have heard a man ask
how two different gases, hydrogen and oxygen,
when united, should form a liquid, and
not a gas. I wish you could see things as
we see them. The atoms are neither gaseous,
liquid, nor solid; they are little worlds of
revolving electrons.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the attraction between
atoms, and again between molecules, in form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ing
a solid body. It will be clear that there
is less of this <i>cohesive force</i> in the case of a
liquid, whereas it is absent entirely in the
case of a gas. In this case the molecules have
become so far separated from one another
that they cease to attract each other, and if
left free they will soon part company, and
spread themselves broadcast over the face of
the earth.</p>

<p>Whether a substance passes into a solid, a
liquid, or a gaseous state, the atoms remain
constant, but their vibratory motion is
altered very considerably. However, I was
about to tell you that we electrons can make
some very interesting combinations of atoms.
Those I have mentioned so far are of a very
simple nature, but we have built up individual
molecules containing hundreds of atoms. We
link about a hundred atoms together and
produce a molecule of what man calls <i>alum</i>,
and we require to unite about a thousand
atoms together to make one molecule of
<i>albumen</i> (the white of an egg).</p>


<p>When man speaks of a chemical change
having taken place in a substance, it is simply
the electrons who have made a friendly
inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>change
of detachable electrons, thereby causing
a different assemblage of the same atoms.
During these changes we never alter the
nature of the atom. That little world of revolving
electrons known as an atom of gold,
remains always an atom of gold. But you
must not run away with the idea that the
atoms will never change. Indeed, man has
discovered that the atoms are not eternal, as
I shall explain in the following chapter.</p>

We electrons were amused at the stir which we
unconsciously caused throughout the civilised
world. We had done nothing different from
what we had been doing for ages, but a few
men had been taking note of what we were
about, and when the phenomena to which
I refer became known to the world, many
wild rumours were circulated.</p>

<p>One of these rumours was to the effect
that steam-engines and their expensive furnaces
were to disappear very quickly. If
the two last words had been omitted&mdash;I
should not say that the prophecy is untrue,
but man has a long way to travel yet before
reaching that goal. My fellows within
the atoms have sufficient energy to supply
all mankind with power if he could but unlock
even a small fraction of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Another statement was that this newly
discovered substance, <i>radium</i>, could cure some
diseases which man had believed to be incurable.
All I shall say about this is that the
statement was an exaggerated one.</p>

<p>Then it was said that radium disproved
much of man's scientific knowledge, but
instead of that being so, we electrons have
greatly extended man's knowledge by our
radio-active actions. If any man believed
the atoms of matter to be eternal, we certainly
disproved that. Here, in radium, man
could see atoms going to pieces.</p>

<p>I have questioned a fellow-electron who
escaped from a radium atom as to what
upset their equilibrium, but I find that he
does not know, or he pretends not to know.
All he has told me is that he was flung off
suddenly from within the atom with great
energy, for he had been revolving at a
tremendous speed. In his sudden flight he
passed some newly formed <i>helium</i> atoms,
which contained many of those electrons
who had been his co-partners in the former
radium atom. Being an electron, he was
travelling at a far greater speed than these
flying atoms of matter, but he assures me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that these helium atoms were going faster
than atoms can travel under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>Another thing that this escaped electron
told me was that when he and his fellow-electrons
made a sudden start on leaving
the atom of radium they caused a proper
splash in the surrounding &aelig;ther, just such
as we electrons produce when we are suddenly
stopped in an X-ray tube. Man observed
these rays proceeding from radium, but, not
knowing the cause of them, he called them
<i>gamma rays</i>. We can, of course, produce
radiographs when these rays fall upon
photographic plates. Indeed, some of my
fellow-electrons, when escaping from radium,
have produced rays sufficient to penetrate
a six-inch boulder and affect a photographic
plate lying beneath the boulder. In time
man recognised these rays as X-rays.</p>

<p>Man did not find only these rays&mdash;he discovered
that electrons were escaping, but
before he had recognised what we were, he
had named us <i>beta rays</i>. These fast-flying
electrons have had experiences which never
fall to electrons except when escaping from
an atom. Their velocity is so great that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
they can be shot right through a sheet of
aluminium foil. If these escaped electrons
are allowed to settle on any object, they will
necessarily cause an overcrowding, or, in
other words, the object will become negatively
electrified.</p>

<p>The one thing that puzzled man most was
to find out what the helium atoms were. He
had named them <i>alpha</i> rays, but as he found
he could not get them to penetrate even a
thin sheet of paper, he was confident that
they must be atoms of matter. It was only
when he had gathered sufficient to examine
the spectrum that he found these to be
helium atoms.</p>

<p>I think what really made the world talk
was the fact that electrons were escaping
from what had been supposed to be an eternal
habitation. In other words, this material
radium was actually going to pieces. That
is to say, <i>gradually</i>, as far as man is concerned,
for, looking at it from our point of
view, the word <i>gradual</i> seems out of place
entirely. The breaking up of an atom is
really of the nature of an explosion. It is
a continual bombardment that is proceeding
in radium. Why man is apt to think of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
as a gradual effect is that there is such an
enormous number of atoms in a tiny speck
of radium, that even the incessant series of
explosions will take a very long time to
break down the whole of the small particle.</p>

<p>Electrons differ in their opinions as to
whether man will succeed in drawing upon
this internal energy of the atom. My own
difficulty is that, having been a roaming
electron at all times, I have no idea regarding
the cause of the atomic explosions. I
have remarked already that the electrons
locked up within the atoms possess more
energy than man could ever use. If all
these electrons were deprived of their energy,
the atoms of matter would cease to exist,
and man, where would he be?</p>

<h3><i>THE SCRIBE'S NOTE ON CHAPTER TWENTY</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Not many of us have realised the true importance
of electrons in the Creator's plans.</p>

<p>In the following short chapter the electron
is made to sum up a few of the wonders
which it has related, in order to focus our
attention upon the grand place which the
electrons occupy in the universe.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
From what I have told you of myself and my
fellow-electrons, it must be apparent that
we are of tremendous importance to man.
I have told you something of the part we
played in building up this world&mdash;how we
not only form the atoms of matter, but also
hold these bricks of the universe together.
I have given you a rough sketch of the composition
of these bricks.</p>

<p>You must have realised also that without
us the whole universe would be in darkness.
There would be no light, no heat, and consequently
no life. Indeed, there could be no
material existence without us.</p>

<p>Where would man be if we failed to perform
our mission? He could not exist if we
even neglected a few of our duties. Not only
do we form the atoms of which his body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
is composed, also holding these together, but
we produce all those chemical changes within
his body which are absolutely necessary to
maintain life. His very thoughts are dependent
upon our activities.</p>

<p>I have told you how we send man's messages
across the earth, and how we transmit power
from place to place. Also how we have enabled
man to gain knowledge of the distant
stars, and to examine the bones of his living
body.</p>


<p>If man could cross-examine me or any of
my fellows, I expect the first question would
be&mdash;What are you electrons made of? But
man must find this out for himself. The
Creator has placed man in a world full of
activity, and it is of intense interest to man
to discover the meaning of all that lies around
him. That is why I have been bound over
by my fellows to tell you only so much of
our history as man has discovered. But I
am disclosing no secret when I admit that
our very existence as electrons is dependent
upon the &aelig;ther.</p>


<p>If I can find another scribe to write a
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>vised
biography for me a few hundred years
hence, I shall have a much more interesting
tale to tell, for many of our doings, of which
man knows nothing at present, will be secrets
no longer by that time.</p>

It was known two thousand years ago that
when a piece of amber was rubbed with a
woollen cloth, the amber would attract light
objects towards it. Amber was considered to
be unique in this respect.</p>


<p>About the year 1600, one of Queen Elizabeth's
physicians, Dr. William Gilbert, inquired
into this attractive property of amber.
He found that many other substances possessed
the same property. Indeed it is
common to all substances in some degree.
We say the amber or other object is "electrified."</p>


<p>It was observed by the early experimenters
that there were two kinds of electrification.
To one of these they gave the name <i>positive
electricity</i>, and to the other <i>negative electricity</i>.</p>


<p>Every electrified object will attract an
ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>ject
which is not electrified, and two objects
which are oppositely electrified will attract
one another also. But two objects which are
similarly electrified will repel each other.</p>


<p>Man got tired of rubbing objects by hand,
so he fitted up simple machines in which glass
cylinders or plates were rubbed against
leather cushions. The electricity was then
collected by little metal points supported on
an insulated metal sphere.</p>


<p>The experiment of attempting to store
electricity in a glass vessel filled with water
was made at the University of Leyden
(Netherlands). The water was replaced later
by a coating of tin-foil on the inner surface,
while a similar metallic coating on the outside
took the place of the experimenter's hand.
These jars are called <i>Leyden jars</i>, after the
place in which the discovery was made.</p>


<p>About 1790, Professor Galvani, of Italy,
observed that the legs of a freshly killed frog
twitched at each discharge of an electrical
machine. Later he found that the same
twitching occurred when he connected certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
parts with a piece of copper and zinc. He
believed this to be due to "animal electricity"
secreted within the frog.</p>


<p>Professor Volta, also of Italy, proved that
Galvani's idea was wrong, and that the electricity
resided in the metals rather than in the
frog. He showed that when two pieces of
dissimilar metal were put in contact with one
another, there was a slight transference of
electricity between them. He constructed a
pile of copper and zinc discs, with a moist
cloth between each pair or couple, and by
connecting wires from the top copper disc to
the lowest zinc disc he was able to show that
an appreciable current of electricity was produced.
Later he placed a piece of copper and
a piece of zinc in a vessel containing acidulated
water, whereupon he found that a steady
current of electricity was obtained. This was
the invention of electric batteries.</p>


<p>The phenomena of <i>magnetism</i> were known
to the ancients, but it was not until the nineteenth
century that we found any real
connection between electricity and magnetism.
In 1819, a Danish philosopher, Hans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Christian Oersted, discovered that an electric
current passing in a wire affected a magnet in
its neighbourhood. If the magnet was supported
on a pivot, after the manner of a
compass needle, it would turn round and take
up a position at right angles to the wire
carrying the electric current.</p>


<p>The molecular theory of magnetism presumes
that every molecule of iron is a tiny
magnet, having a north and south pole. In
a piece of unmagnetised iron, these tiny
magnets are all lying so that they neutralise
one another. When they are turned round
so that their north poles are all lying in one
direction, then the iron is said to be magnetised.</p>


<p>The electron theory of magnetism does not
do away with the older molecular theory just
referred to. The electron theory goes a step
farther, and tells us that these molecules are
magnets because of a steady motion of electrons
around the atoms of iron.</p>


<p>It was discovered in 1825 that when an
electric current was sent through an insulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
wire wound around a piece of soft iron, the
iron became a magnet; when the current was
stopped the magnetism disappeared. Such
magnets are called <i>electro-magnets</i>. If a piece
of hard steel is treated in the same way it
becomes a <i>permanent magnet</i>. It was this
intimate connection between electricity and
magnetism, or, in other words, the invention
of these electro-magnets, which brought us
electric bells, telegraphs, telephones, dynamos,
and electric motors.</p>


<p>It should be noted that while iron is
attracted by either pole of a magnet, there
is such a thing as magnetic repulsion. This,
however, takes place only between two magnets,
and then only between like poles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some German physicists made a number of
electrical experiments with vacuum tubes.
When Sir William Crookes (England) was
experimenting with similar vacuum tubes he
suggested that matter was in a "radiant"
state during the electric discharge within the
tubes.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
In 1880, H. A. Lorentz, of Amsterdam,
declared that light was due to the motion
of small particles revolving around the atoms
of matter.</p>


<p>Professor Zeeman, of Holland, produced
experimental proof of Lorentz's theory. He
showed that the revolving "particles" were
influenced by a powerful magnetic field, in the
manner explained in the electron's story.
This discovery was made in 1896, or sixteen
years after Lorentz's declaration. It was
Dr. Johnstone Stoney, of Dublin University
(Ireland), who christened these particles
"electrons."</p>


<p>The X-rays were observed for the first time
by Professor Roentgen, of Germany, in 1895.
The screens used for viewing the luminous
effects produced by the X-rays are coated
with very fine crystals of <i>barium platinocyanide</i>.
These screens were in use for
another purpose previous to the discovery
of X-rays.</p>


<p>We know now that <i>chemical affinity</i> is
merely electrical attraction between the atoms
of matter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
The spectroscope consists of a glass prism,
or series of prisms, mounted between two
metal tubes. One tube is provided at one
end with a vertical slit, through which the
light that is to be examined is passed. At
the other end of the tube is a lens, so that
the beam of light from the slit emerges
through the lens as a pencil of parallel rays.
The pencil of light then falls upon the glass
prism, striking it at an angle. In passing
through the prism, the light is bent round
so that it enters the second tube, which is
simply a small telescope. The prism separates
the &aelig;ther waves according to their wave-lengths,
and produces the well-known coloured
spectrum, which is magnified by the telescope.
The reason for the bending of the different
waves is explained in the electron's story.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
